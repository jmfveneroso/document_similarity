talk but which spoke not onli in these silent symbol of the after dinner face but more often and loudli in the act of hi life he wa auster with himself drank gin when he wa alon to mortifi a tast for vintag and though he enjoi the theatr had not cross the door of on for twenti year but he had an approv toler for other sometim wonder almost with envi at the high pressur of spirit involv in their misde and in ani extrem inclin to help rather than to reprov i inclin to cain s heresi he us to sai quaintli i let my brother go to the devil in hi own wai in thi charact it wa frequent hi fortun to be the last reput acquaint and the last good influenc in the live of down go men and to such as these so long as thei came about hi chamber he never mark a shade of chang in hi demeanour no doubt the feat wa easi to mr utterson for he wa undemonstr at the best and even hi friendship seem to be found in a similar cathol of good natur it is the mark of a modest man to accept hi friendli circl readi made from the hand of opportun and that wa the lawyer s wai hi friend were those of hi own blood or those whom he had known the longest hi affect like ivi were the growth of time thei impli no apt in the object henc no doubt the bond that unit him to mr richard enfield hi distant kinsman the well known man about town it wa a nut to crack for mani what these two could see in each other or what subject thei could find in common it wa report by those who encount them in their sundai walk that thei said noth look singularli dull and would hail with obviou relief the appear of a friend for all that the two men put the greatest store by these excurs count them the chief jewel of each week and not onli set asid occas of pleasur but even resist the call of busi that thei might enjoi them uninterrupt it chanc on on of these rambl that their wai led them down a by street in a busi quarter of london the street wa small and what is call quiet but it drove a thrive trade on the week dai the inhabit were all do well it seem and all emul hope to do better still and lai out the surplu of their gain in coquetri so that the shop front stood along that thoroughfar with an air of invit like row of smile saleswomen even on sundai when it veil it more florid charm and lai compar empti of passag the street shone out in contrast to it dingi neighbourhood like a fire in a forest and with it freshli paint shutter well polish brass and gener cleanli and gaieti of note instantli caught and pleas the ey of the passeng two door from on corner on the left hand go east the line wa broken by the entri of a court and just at that point a certain sinist block of build thrust forward it gabl on the street it wa two stori high show no window noth but a door on the lower stori and a blind forehead of discolour wall on the upper and bore in everi featur the mark of prolong and sordid neglig the door which wa equip with neither bell nor knocker wa blister and distain tramp slouch into the recess and struck match on the panel children kept shop upon the step the schoolboi had tri hi knife on the mould and for close on a gener no on had appear to drive awai these random visitor or to repair their ravag mr enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by street but when thei came abreast of the entri the former lift up hi cane and point did you ever remark that door he ask and when hi companion had repli in the affirm it is connect in my mind ad he with a veri odd stori inde said mr utterson with a slight chang of voic and what wa that well it wa thi wai return mr enfield i wa come home from some place at the end of the world about three o clock of a black winter morn and my wai lai through a part of town where there wa liter noth to be seen but lamp street after street and all the folk asleep street after street all light up as if for a process and all as empti as a church till at last i got into that state of mind when a man listen and listen and begin to long for the sight of a policeman all at onc i saw two figur on a littl man who wa stump along eastward at a good walk and the other a girl of mayb eight or ten who wa run as hard as she wa abl down a cross street well sir the two ran into on anoth natur enough at the corner and then came the horribl part of the thing for the man trampl calmli over the child s bodi and left her scream on the ground it sound noth to hear but it wa hellish to see it wasn t like a man it wa like some damn juggernaut i gave a view halloa took to my heel collar my gentleman and brought him back to where there wa alreadi quit a group about the scream child he wa perfectli cool and made no resist but gave me on look so ugli that it brought out the sweat on me like run the peopl who had turn out were the girl s own famili and pretti soon the doctor for whom she had been sent put in hi appear well the child wa not much the wors more frighten accord to the sawbon and there you might have suppos would be an end to it but there wa on curiou circumst i had taken a loath to my gentleman at first sight so had the child s famili which wa onli natur but the doctor s case wa what struck me he wa the usual cut and dry apothecari of no particular ag and colour with a strong edinburgh accent and about as emot as a bagpip well sir he wa like the rest of us everi time he look at my prison i saw that sawbon turn sick and white with the desir to kill him i knew what wa in hi mind just as he knew what wa in mine and kill be out of the question we did the next best we told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of thi as should make hi name stink from on end of london to the other if he had ani friend or ani credit we undertook that he should lose them and all the time as we were pitch it in red hot we were keep the women off him as best we could for thei were as wild as harpi i never saw a circl of such hate face and there wa the man in the middl with a kind of black sneer cool frighten too i could see that but carri it off sir realli like satan if you choos to make capit out of thi accid said he i am natur helpless no gentleman but wish to avoid a scene sai he name your figur well we screw him up to a hundr pound for the child s famili he would have clearli like to stick out but there wa someth about the lot of us that meant mischief and at last he struck the next thing wa to get the monei and where do you think he carri us but to that place with the door whip out a kei went in and present came back with the matter of ten pound in gold and a chequ for the balanc on coutt s drawn payabl to bearer and sign with a name that i can t mention though it s on of the point of my stori but it wa a name at least veri well known and often print the figur wa stiff but the signatur wa good for more than that if it wa onli genuin i took the liberti of point out to my gentleman that the whole busi look apocryph and that a man doe not in real life walk into a cellar door at four in the morn and come out of it with anoth man s chequ for close upon a hundr pound but he wa quit easi and sneer set your mind at rest sai he i will stai with you till the bank open and cash the chequ myself so we all set off the doctor and the child s father and our friend and myself and pass the rest of the night in my chamber and next dai when we had breakfast went in a bodi to the bank i gave in the check myself and said i had everi reason to believ it wa a forgeri not a bit of it the chequ wa genuin tut tut said mr utterson i see you feel as i do said mr enfield ye it s a bad stori for my man wa a fellow that nobodi could have to do with a realli damnabl man and the person that drew the chequ is the veri pink of the proprieti celebr too and what make it wors on of your fellow who do what thei call good black mail i suppos an honest man pai through the nose for some of the caper of hi youth black mail hous is what i call that place with the door in consequ though even that you know is far from explain all he ad and with the word fell into a vein of muse from thi he wa recal by mr utterson ask rather suddenli and you don t know if the drawer of the chequ live there a like place isn t it return mr enfield but i happen to have notic hi address he live in some squar or other and you never ask about the place with the door said mr utterson no sir i had a delicaci wa the repli i feel veri strongli about put question it partak too much of the style of the dai of judgment you start a question and it s like start a stone you sit quietli on the top of a hill and awai the stone goe start other and present some bland old bird the last you would have thought of is knock on the head in hi own back garden and the famili have to chang their name no sir i make it a rule of mine the more it look like queer street the less i ask a veri good rule too said the lawyer but i have studi the place for myself continu mr enfield it seem scarc a hous there is no other door and nobodi goe in or out of that on but onc in a great while the gentleman of my adventur there ar three window look on the court on the first floor none below the window ar alwai shut but thei re clean and then there is a chimnei which is gener smoke so somebodi must live there and yet it s not so sure for the build ar so pack togeth about that court that it s hard to sai where on end and anoth begin the pair walk on again for a while in silenc and then enfield said mr utterson that s a good rule of your ye i think it is return enfield but for all that continu the lawyer there s on point i want to ask i want to ask the name of that man who walk over the child well said mr enfield i can t see what harm it would do it wa a man of the name of hyde h m said mr utterson what sort of a man is he to see he is not easi to describ there is someth wrong with hi appear someth displeas someth downright detest i never saw a man i so dislik and yet i scarc know why he must be deform somewher he give a strong feel of deform although i couldn t specifi the point he s an extraordinari look man and yet i realli can name noth out of the wai no sir i can make no hand of it i can t describ him and it s not want of memori for i declar i can see him thi moment mr utterson again walk some wai in silenc and obvious under a weight of consider you ar sure he us a kei he inquir at last my dear sir began enfield surpris out of himself ye i know said utterson i know it must seem strang the fact is if i do not ask you the name of the other parti it is becaus i know it alreadi you see richard your tale ha gone home if you have been inexact in ani point you had better correct it i think you might have warn me return the other with a touch of sullen but i have been pedant exact as you call it the fellow had a kei and what s more he ha it still i saw him us it not a week ago mr utterson sigh deepli but said never a word and the young man present resum here is anoth lesson to sai noth said he i am asham of my long tongu let us make a bargain never to refer to thi again with all my heart said the lawyer i shake hand on that richard search for mr hyde that even mr utterson came home to hi bachelor hous in sombr spirit and sat down to dinner without relish it wa hi custom of a sundai when thi meal wa over to sit close by the fire a volum of some dry divin on hi read desk until the clock of the neighbour church rang out the hour of twelv when he would go soberli and gratefulli to bed on thi night howev as soon as the cloth wa taken awai he took up a candl and went into hi busi room there he open hi safe took from the most privat part of it a document endors on the envelop as dr jekyl s will and sat down with a cloud brow to studi it content the will wa holograph for mr utterson though he took charg of it now that it wa made had refus to lend the least assist in the make of it it provid not onli that in case of the deceas of henri jekyl m d d c l l l d f r s etc all hi possess were to pass into the hand of hi friend and benefactor edward hyde but that in case of dr jekyl s disappear or unexplain absenc for ani period exceed three calendar month the said edward hyde should step into the said henri jekyl s shoe without further delai and free from ani burthen or oblig beyond the payment of a few small sum to the member of the doctor s household thi document had long been the lawyer s eyesor it offend him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customari side of life to whom the fanci wa the immodest and hitherto it wa hi ignor of mr hyde that had swell hi indign now by a sudden turn it wa hi knowledg it wa alreadi bad enough when the name wa but a name of which he could learn no more it wa wors when it began to be cloth upon with detest attribut and out of the shift insubstanti mist that had so long baffl hi ey there leap up the sudden definit present of a fiend i thought it wa mad he said as he replac the obnoxi paper in the safe and now i begin to fear it is disgrac with that he blew out hi candl put on a great coat and set forth in the direct of cavendish squar that citadel of medicin where hi friend the great dr lanyon had hi hous and receiv hi crowd patient if ani on know it will be lanyon he had thought the solemn butler knew and welcom him he wa subject to no stage of delai but usher direct from the door to the dine room where dr lanyon sat alon over hi wine thi wa a hearti healthi dapper red face gentleman with a shock of hair prematur white and a boister and decid manner at sight of mr utterson he sprang up from hi chair and welcom him with both hand the genial as wa the wai of the man wa somewhat theatric to the ey but it repos on genuin feel for these two were old friend old mate both at school and colleg both thorough respect of themselv and of each other and what doe not alwai follow men who thoroughli enjoi each other s compani after a littl rambl talk the lawyer led up to the subject which so disagre pre occupi hi mind i suppos lanyon said he you and i must be the two oldest friend that henri jekyl ha i wish the friend were younger chuckl dr lanyon but i suppos we ar and what of that i see littl of him now inde said utterson i thought you had a bond of common interest we had wa the repli but it is more than ten year sinc henri jekyl becam too fanci for me he began to go wrong wrong in mind and though of cours i continu to take an interest in him for old sake s sake as thei sai i see and i have seen devilish littl of the man such unscientif balderdash ad the doctor flush suddenli purpl would have estrang damon and pythia thi littl spirit of temper wa somewhat of a relief to mr utterson thei have onli differ on some point of scienc he thought and be a man of no scientif passion except in the matter of conveyanc he even ad it is noth wors than that he gave hi friend a few second to recov hi composur and then approach the question he had come to put did you ever come across a proteg of hi on hyde he ask hyde repeat lanyon no never heard of him sinc my time that wa the amount of inform that the lawyer carri back with him to the great dark bed on which he toss to and fro until the small hour of the morn began to grow larg it wa a night of littl eas to hi toil mind toil in mere dark and besieg by question six o clock struck on the bell of the church that wa so conveni near to mr utterson s dwell and still he wa dig at the problem hitherto it had touch him on the intellectu side alon but now hi imagin also wa engag or rather enslav and as he lai and toss in the gross dark of the night and the curtain room mr enfield s tale went by befor hi mind in a scroll of light pictur he would be awar of the great field of lamp of a nocturn citi then of the figur of a man walk swiftli then of a child run from the doctor s and then these met and that human juggernaut trod the child down and pass on regardless of her scream or els he would see a room in a rich hous where hi friend lai asleep dream and smile at hi dream and then the door of that room would be open the curtain of the bed pluck apart the sleeper recal and lo there would stand by hi side a figur to whom power wa given and even at that dead hour he must rise and do it bid the figur in these two phase haunt the lawyer all night and if at ani time he doze over it wa but to see it glide more stealthili through sleep hous or move the more swiftli and still the more swiftli even to dizzi through wider labyrinth of lamplight citi and at everi street corner crush a child and leav her scream and still the figur had no face by which he might know it even in hi dream it had no face or on that baffl him and melt befor hi ey and thu it wa that there sprang up and grew apac in the lawyer s mind a singularli strong almost an inordin curios to behold the featur of the real mr hyde if he could but onc set ey on him he thought the mysteri would lighten and perhap roll altogeth awai as wa the habit of mysteri thing when well examin he might see a reason for hi friend s strang prefer or bondag call it which you pleas and even for the startl claus of the will at least it would be a face worth see the face of a man who wa without bowel of merci a face which had but to show itself to rais up in the mind of the unimpression enfield a spirit of endur hatr from that time forward mr utterson began to haunt the door in the by street of shop in the morn befor offic hour at noon when busi wa plenti and time scarc at night under the face of the fog citi moon by all light and at all hour of solitud or concours the lawyer wa to be found on hi chosen post if he be mr hyde he had thought i shall be mr seek and at last hi patienc wa reward it wa a fine dry night frost in the air the street as clean as a ballroom floor the lamp unshaken by ani wind draw a regular pattern of light and shadow by ten o clock when the shop were close the by street wa veri solitari and in spite of the low growl of london from all round veri silent small sound carri far domest sound out of the hous were clearli audibl on either side of the roadwai and the rumour of the approach of ani passeng preced him by a long time mr utterson had been some minut at hi post when he wa awar of an odd light footstep draw near in the cours of hi nightli patrol he had long grown accustom to the quaint effect with which the footfal of a singl person while he is still a great wai off suddenli spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the citi yet hi attent had never befor been so sharpli and decis arrest and it wa with a strong superstiti previs of success that he withdrew into the entri of the court the step drew swiftli nearer and swell out suddenli louder as thei turn the end of the street the lawyer look forth from the entri could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with he wa small and veri plainli dress and the look of him even at that distanc went somehow strongli against the watcher s inclin but he made straight for the door cross the roadwai to save time and as he came he drew a kei from hi pocket like on approach home mr utterson step out and touch him on the shoulder as he pass mr hyde i think mr hyde shrank back with a hiss intak of the breath but hi fear wa onli momentari and though he did not look the lawyer in the face he answer coolli enough that is my name what do you want i see you ar go in return the lawyer i am an old friend of dr jekyl s mr utter son of gaunt street you must have heard my name and meet you so conveni i thought you might admit me you will not find dr jekyl he is from home repli mr hyde blow in the kei and then suddenli but still without look up how did you know me he ask on your side said mr utterson will you do me a favour with pleasur repli the other what shall it be will you let me see your face ask the lawyer mr hyde appear to hesit and then as if upon some sudden reflect front about with an air of defianc and the pair stare at each other pretti fixedli for a few second now i shall know you again said mr utterson it mai be us ye return mr hyde it is as well we have met and a propo you should have my address and he gave a number of a street in soho good god thought mr utterson can he too have been think of the will but he kept hi feel to himself and onli grunt in acknowledg of the address and now said the other how did you know me by descript wa the repli whose descript we have common friend said mr utterson common friend echo mr hyde a littl hoars who ar thei jekyl for instanc said the lawyer he never told you cri mr hyde with a flush of anger i did not think you would have li come said mr utterson that is not fit languag the other snarl aloud into a savag laugh and the next moment with extraordinari quick he had unlock the door and disappear into the hous the lawyer stood awhil when mr hyde had left him the pictur of disquietud then he began slowli to mount the street paus everi step or two and put hi hand to hi brow like a man in mental perplex the problem he wa thu debat as he walk wa on of a class that is rare solv mr hyde wa pale and dwarfish he gave an impress of deform without ani nameabl malform he had a displeas smile he had born himself to the lawyer with a sort of murder mixtur of timid and bold and he spoke with a huski whisper and somewhat broken voic all these were point against him but not all of these togeth could explain the hitherto unknown disgust loath and fear with which mr utterson regard him there must be some thing els said the perplex gentleman there is someth more if i could find a name for it god bless me the man seem hardli human someth troglodyt shall we sai or can it be the old stori of dr fell or is it the mere radianc of a foul soul that thu transpir through and transfigur it clai contin the last i think for o my poor old harri jekyl if ever i read satan s signatur upon a face it is on that of your new friend round the corner from the by street there wa a squar of ancient handsom hous now for the most part decai from their high estat and let in flat and chamber to all sort and condit of men map engrav architect shadi lawyer and the agent of obscur enterpris on hous howev second from the corner wa still occupi entir and at the door of thi which wore a great air of wealth and comfort though it wa now plung in dark except for the fan light mr utterson stop and knock a well dress elderli servant open the door is dr jekyl at home pool ask the lawyer i will see mr utterson said pool admit the visitor as he spoke into a larg low roof comfort hall pave with flag warm after the fashion of a countri hous by a bright open fire and furnish with costli cabinet of oak will you wait here by the fire sir or shall i give you a light in the dine room here thank you said the lawyer and he drew near and lean on the tall fender thi hall in which he wa now left alon wa a pet fanci of hi friend the doctor s and utterson himself wa wont to speak of it as the pleasantest room in london but to night there wa a shudder in hi blood the face of hyde sat heavi on hi memori he felt what wa rare with him a nausea and distast of life and in the gloom of hi spirit he seem to read a menac in the flicker of the firelight on the polish cabinet and the uneasi start of the shadow on the roof he wa asham of hi relief when pool present return to announc that dr jekyl wa gone out i saw mr hyde go in by the old dissect room door pool he said is that right when dr jekyl is from home quit right mr utterson sir repli the servant mr hyde ha a kei

o dear no sir he never dine here repli the butler inde we see veri littl of him on thi side of the hous he mostli come and goe by the laboratori well good night pool good night mr utterson and the lawyer set out homeward with a veri heavi heart poor harri jekyl he thought my mind misgiv me he is in deep water he wa wild when he wa young a long while ago to be sure but in the law of god there is no statut of limit ay it must be that the ghost of some old sin the cancer of some conceal disgrac punish come pede claudo year after memori ha forgotten and self love condon the fault and the lawyer scare by the thought brood a while on hi own past grope in all the corner of memori lest by chanc some jack in the box of an old iniqu should leap to light there hi past wa fairli blameless few men could read the roll of their life with less apprehens yet he wa humbl to the dust by the mani ill thing he had done and rais up again into a sober and fear gratitud by the mani that he had come so near to do yet avoid and then by a return on hi former subject he conceiv a spark of hope thi master hyde if he were studi thought he must have secret of hi own black secret by the look of him secret compar to which poor jekyl s worst would be like sunshin thing cannot continu as thei ar it turn me cold to think of thi creatur steal like a thief to harri s bedsid poor harri what a waken and the

lest the good name of anoth should be suck down in the eddi of the scandal it wa at least a ticklish decis that he had to make and self reliant as he wa by habit he began to cherish a long for advic it wa not to be had directli but perhap he thought it might be fish for present after he sat on on side of hi own hearth with mr guest hi head clerk upon the other and midwai between at a nice calcul distanc from the fire a bottl of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsun in the foundat of hi hous the fog still slept on the wing abov the drown citi where the lamp glimmer like carbuncl and through the muffl and smother of these fallen cloud the process of the town s life wa still roll in through the great arteri with a sound as of a mighti wind but the room wa gai with firelight in the bottl the acid were long ago resolv the imperi dye had soften with time as the colour grow richer in stain window and the glow of hot autumn afternoon on hillsid vineyard wa readi to be set free and to dispers the fog of london insens the lawyer melt there wa no man from whom he kept fewer secret than mr guest and he wa not alwai sure that he kept as mani as he meant guest had often been on busi to the doctor s he knew pool he could scarc have fail to hear of mr hyde s familiar about the hous he might draw conclus wa it not as well then that he should see a letter which put that mysteri to right and abov all sinc guest be a great student and critic of handwrit would consid the step natur and oblig the clerk besid wa a man of counsel he would scarc read so strang a document without drop a remark and by that remark mr utterson might shape hi futur cours thi is a sad busi about sir danver he said ye sir inde it ha elicit a great deal of public feel return guest the man of cours wa mad i should like to hear your view on that repli utterson i have a document here in hi handwrit it is between ourselv for i scarc know what to do about it it is an ugli busi at the best but there it is quit in your wai a murder s autograph guest s ey brighten and he sat down at onc and studi it with passion no sir he said not mad but it is an odd hand and by all account a veri odd writer ad the lawyer just then the servant enter with a note is that from dr jekyl sir inquir the clerk i thought i knew the write anyth privat mr utterson onli an invit to dinner why do you want to see it on moment i thank you sir and the clerk laid the two sheet of paper alongsid and sedul compar their content thank you sir he said at last return both it s a veri interest autograph there wa a paus dure which mr utterson struggl with himself why did you compar them guest he inquir suddenli well sir return the clerk there s a rather singular resembl the two hand ar in mani point ident onli differ slope rather quaint said utterson it is as you sai rather quaint return guest i wouldn t speak of thi note you know said the master no sir said the clerk i understand but no sooner wa mr utterson alon that night than he lock the note into hi safe where it repos from that time forward what he thought henri jekyl forg for a murder and hi blood ran cold in hi vein remark incid of dr lanyon time ran on thousand of pound were offer in reward for the death of sir danver wa resent as a public injuri but mr hyde had disappear out of the ken of the polic as though he had never exist much of hi past wa unearth inde and all disreput tale came out of the man s cruelti at onc so callou and violent of hi vile life of hi strang associ of the hatr that seem to have surround hi career but of hi present whereabout not a whisper from the time he had left the hous in soho on the morn of the murder he wa simpli blot out and gradual as time drew on mr utterson began to recov from the hot of hi alarm and to grow more at quiet with himself the death of sir danver wa to hi wai of think more than paid for by the disappear of mr hyde now that that evil influenc had been withdrawn a new life began for dr jekyl he came out of hi seclus renew relat with hi friend becam onc more their familiar guest and entertain and whilst he had alwai been known for chariti he wa now no less distinguish for religion he wa busi he wa much in the open air he did good hi face seem to open and brighten as if with an inward conscious of servic and for more than two month the doctor wa at peac on the th of januari utterson had dine at the doctor s with a small parti lanyon had been there and the face of the host had look from on to the other as in the old dai when the trio were insepar friend on the th and again on the th the door wa shut against the lawyer the doctor wa confin to the hous pool said and saw no on on the th he tri again and wa again refus and have now been us for the last two month to see hi friend almost daili he found thi return of solitud to weigh upon hi spirit the fifth night he had in guest to dine with him and the sixth he betook himself to dr lanyon s there at least he wa not deni admitt but when he came in he wa shock at the chang which had taken place in the doctor s appear he had hi death warrant written legibl upon hi face the rosi man had grown pale hi flesh had fallen awai he wa visibl balder and older and yet it wa not so much these token of a swift physic decai that arrest the lawyer s notic as a look in the ey and qualiti of manner that seem to testifi to some deep seat terror of the mind it wa unlik that the doctor should fear death and yet that wa what utterson wa tempt to suspect ye he thought he is a doctor he must know hi own state and that hi dai ar count and the knowledg is more than he can bear and yet when utterson remark on hi ill look it wa with an air of great that lanyon declar himself a doom man i have had a shock he said and i shall never recov it is a question of week well life ha been pleasant i like it ye sir i us to like it i sometim think if we knew all we should be more glad to get awai jekyl is ill too observ utterson have you seen him but lanyon s face chang and he held up a trembl hand i wish to see or hear no more of dr jekyl he said in a loud unsteadi voic i am quit done with that person and i beg that you will spare me ani allus to on whom i regard as dead tut tut said mr utterson and then after a consider paus can t i do anyth he inquir we ar three veri old friend lanyon we shall not live to make other noth can be done return lanyon ask himself he will not see me said the lawyer i am not surpris at that wa the repli some dai utterson after i am dead you mai perhap come to learn the right and wrong of thi i cannot tell you and in the meantim if you can sit and talk with me of other thing for god s sake stai and do so but if you cannot keep clear of thi accurs topic then in god s name go for i cannot bear it as soon as he got home utterson sat down and wrote to jekyl complain of hi exclus from the hous and ask the caus of thi unhappi break with lanyon and the next dai brought him a long answer often veri pathet word and sometim darkli mysteri in drift the quarrel with lanyon wa incur i do not blame our old friend jekyl wrote but i share hi view that we must never meet i mean from henceforth to lead a life of extrem seclus you must not be surpris nor must you doubt my friendship if my door is often shut even to you you must suffer me to go my own dark wai i have brought on myself a punish and a danger that i cannot name if i am the chief of sinner i am the chief of suffer also i could not think that thi earth contain a place for suffer and terror so unman and you can do but on thing utterson to lighten thi destini and that is to respect my silenc utterson wa amaz the dark influenc of hyde had been withdrawn the doctor had return to hi old task and amiti a week ago the prospect had smile with everi promis of a cheer and an honour ag and now in a moment friendship and peac of mind and the whole tenor of hi life were wreck so great and unprepar a chang point to mad but in view of lanyon s manner and word there must lie for it some deeper ground a week afterward dr lanyon took to hi bed and in someth less than a fortnight he wa dead the night after the funer at which he had been sadli affect utterson lock the door of hi busi room and sit there by the light of a melancholi candl drew out and set befor him an envelop address by the hand and seal with the seal of hi dead friend privat for the hand of g j utterson alon and in case of hi predeceas to be destroi unread so it wa emphat superscrib and the lawyer dread to behold the content i have buri on friend to dai he thought what if thi should cost me anoth and then he condemn the fear as a disloyalti and broke the seal within there wa anoth enclosur likewis seal and mark upon the cover as not to be open till the death or disappear of dr henri jekyl utterson could not trust hi ey ye it wa disappear here again as in the mad will which he had long ago restor to it author here again were the idea of a disappear and the name of henri jekyl bracket but in the will that idea had sprung from the sinist suggest of the man hyde it wa set there with a purpos all too plain and horribl written by the hand of lanyon what should it mean a great curios came on the truste to disregard the prohibit and dive at onc to the bottom of these mysteri but profession honour and faith to hi dead friend were stringent oblig and the packet slept in the inmost corner of hi privat safe it is on thing to mortifi curios anoth to conquer it and it mai be doubt if from that dai forth utterson desir the societi of hi surviv friend with the same eager he thought of him kindli but hi thought were disquiet and fear he went to call inde but he wa perhap reliev to be deni admitt perhap in hi heart he prefer to speak with pool upon the doorstep and surround by the air and sound of the open citi rather than to be admit into that hous of voluntari bondag and to sit and speak with it inscrut reclus pool had inde no veri pleasant new to commun the doctor it appear now more than ever confin himself to the cabinet over the laboratori where he would sometim even sleep he wa out of spirit he had grown veri

four time the blow fell but the wood wa tough and the fit were of excel workmanship and it wa not until the fifth that the lock burst in sunder and the wreck of the door fell inward on the carpet the besieg appal by their own riot and the still that had succeed stood back a littl and peer in there lai the cabinet befor their ey in the quiet lamplight a good fire glow and chatter on the hearth the kettl sing it thin strain a drawer or two open paper neatli set forth on the busi tabl and nearer the fire the thing laid out for tea the quietest room you would have said and but for the glaze press

edward hyde he wa dress in cloth far too larg for him cloth of the doctor s big the cord of hi face still move with a semblanc of life but life wa quit gone and by the crush phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernel that hung upon the air utterson knew that he wa look on the bodi of a self destroy we have come too late he said sternli whether to save or punish hyde is gone to hi account and it onli remain for us to find the bodi of your master the far greater proport of the build wa occupi by the theatr which fill almost the whole ground stori and wa light from abov and by the cabinet

the lawyer us echo pool do you not see sir it is broken much as if a man had stamp on it ay continu utterson and the fractur too ar rusti the two men look at each other with a scare thi is beyond me pool said the lawyer let us go back to the cabinet thei mount the stair in silenc and still with an occasion aw struck glanc at the dead bodi proceed more thoroughli to examin the content of the cabinet at on tabl there were trace of chemic work variou measur heap of some white salt be laid on glass saucer as though for an experi in which the unhappi man had been prevent that is the same drug

express a great esteem annot in hi own hand with startl blasphemi next in the cours of their review of the chamber the searcher came to the cheval glass into whose depth thei look with an involuntari horror but it wa so turn as to show them noth but the rosi glow plai on the roof the fire sparkl in a hundr repetit along the glaze front of the press and their own pale and fear counten stoop to look in thi glass have seen some strang thing sir whisper pool and sure none stranger than itself echo the lawyer in the same tone for what did jekyl he caught himself up at the word with a start and then conquer the weak what could jekyl want with it he said you mai sai that said pool next thei turn to the busi tabl on the desk among the neat arrai of paper a larg envelop wa uppermost and bore in the doctor s hand the name of mr utterson the lawyer unseal it and sever enclosur fell to the floor the first wa a will drawn in the same eccentr term as the on which he had return six month befor to serv

but i will leav you that amount of margin not onli in the fear of on of those obstacl that can neither be prevent nor fore seen but becaus an hour when your servant ar in bed is to be prefer for what

the drawer that you will have brought with you from my cabinet then you will have plai your part and earn my gratitud complet five minut afterward if you insist upon an explan you will have understood

less i wa in a posit to judg of it import and an appeal so word could not be set asid without a grave respons i rose accordingli from tabl got into a hansom and drove straight to jekyl s hous the butler wa await my arriv he had receiv by the same post as mine a regist letter of instruct and had sent at onc for a locksmith and a carpent the tradesmen came while we were yet speak and we move in a bodi to old dr denman s surgic theatr from which as you ar doubtless awar jekyl s privat cabinet is most conveni enter the door wa veri strong the lock excel the carpent avow he would have great troubl and have to do much damag if forc were to be us and the locksmith wa near despair but thi last wa a handi fellow and after two hour work the door stood open the press mark e wa unlock and i took out the drawer had it fill up with straw and ti in a sheet and return with it to cavendish squar here i proceed to examin it content the powder were neatli enough made up but not with the niceti of the dispens chemist so that it wa plain thei were of jekyl s privat manufactur and when i open on of the wrapper i found what seem to me a simpl crystallin salt of a white colour the phial to which i next turn my attent might have been about half full of a blood red liquor which wa highli pungent to the sens of smell and seem to me to contain phosphoru and some volatil ether at the other ingredi i could make no guess the book wa an ordinari version book and contain littl but a seri of date these cover a period of mani year but i observ that the entri ceas nearli a year ago and quit abruptli here and there a brief remark wa append to a date usual no more than a singl word doubl occur perhap six time in a total of sever hundr entri and onc veri earli in the list and follow by sever mark of

mani of jekyl s investig to no end of practic us how could the presenc of these articl in my hous affect either the honour the saniti or the life of my flighti colleagu if hi messeng could go to on place why could he not go to anoth and even grant some impedi why wa thi gentleman to be receiv by me in secret the more i reflect the more convinc i grew that i wa deal with a case of cerebr diseas and though i dismiss my servant to bed i load an old revolv that i might be found in some postur of self defenc twelv o clock had scarc rung out over london er the knocker sound veri gentli on the door i went myself at the summon and found a small man crouch against the pillar of the portico ar you come from dr jekyl i ask he told me ye by a constrain gestur and when i had bidden him enter he did not obei me without a search backward glanc into the dark of the squar there wa a policeman not far off advanc with hi bull s ey open and at the sight i thought my visitor start and made greater hast these particular struck me i confess disagre and as i follow him into the bright light of the consult room i kept my hand readi on my weapon here at last i had a chanc of clearli see him i had never set ey on him befor so much wa certain he wa small as i have said i wa struck besid with the shock express of hi face with hi remark combin of great muscular activ and great appar debil of constitut and last but not least with the odd subject disturb caus by hi neighbourhood thi bore some resembl to incipi rigour and wa accompani by a mark sink of the puls at the time i set it down to some idiosyncrat person distast and mere wonder at the acut of the symptom but i have sinc had reason to believ the caus to lie much deeper in the natur of man and to turn on some nobler hing than the principl of hatr thi person who had thu from the first moment of hi entranc struck in me what i can onli describ as a disgust curios wa dress in a fashion that would have made an ordinari person laughabl hi cloth that is to sai although thei were of rich and sober fabric were enorm too larg for him in everi measur the trouser hang on hi leg and roll up to keep them from the ground the waist of the coat below hi haunch and the collar sprawl wide upon hi shoulder strang to relat thi ludicr accoutr wa far from move me to laughter rather as there wa someth abnorm and misb gotten in the veri essenc of the creatur that now face me someth seiz surpris and revolt thi fresh dispar seem but to fit in with and to reinforc it so that to my interest in the man s natur and charact there wa ad a curios as to hi origin hi life hi fortun and statu in the world these observ though thei have taken so great a space to be set down in were yet the work of a few second my visitor wa inde on fire with sombr excit have you got it he cri have you got it and so live wa hi impati that he even laid hi hand upon my arm and sought to shake me i put him back consciou at hi touch of a certain ici pang along my blood come sir said i you forget that i have not yet the pleasur of your acquaint be seat if you pleas and i show him an exampl and sat down myself in my customari seat and with as fair an imit of my ordinari manner to a patient as the late of the hour the natur of my pre occup and the horror i had of my visitor would suffer me to muster i beg your pardon dr lanyon he repli civilli enough what you sai is veri well found and my impati ha shown it heel to my polit i come here at the instanc of your colleagu dr henri jekyl on a piec of busi of some moment and i under stood he paus and put hi hand to hi throat and i could see in spite of hi collect manner that he wa wrestl against the approach of the hysteria i understood a drawer but here i took piti on my visitor s suspens and some perhap on my own grow curios there it is sir said i point to the drawer where it lai on the floor behind a tabl and still cover with the sheet he sprang to it and then paus and laid hi hand upon hi heart i could hear hi teeth grate with the convuls action of hi jaw and hi face wa so ghastli to see that i grew alarm both for hi life and reason compos yourself said i he turn a dread smile to me and as if with the decis of despair pluck awai the sheet at sight of the content he utter on loud sob of such immens relief that i sat petrifi and the next moment in a voic that wa alreadi fairli well under control have you a graduat glass he ask i rose from my place with someth of an effort and gave him what he ask he thank me with a smile nod measur out a few minim of the red tinctur and ad on of the powder the mixtur which wa at first of a reddish hue began in proport as the crystal melt to brighten in colour to effervesc audibl and to throw off small fume of vapour suddenli and at the same moment the ebullit ceas and the compound chang to a dark purpl which fade again more slowli to a wateri green my visitor who had watch these metamorphos with a keen ey smile set down the glass upon the tabl and then turn and look upon me with an air of scrutini and now said he to settl what remain will you be wise will you be guid will you suffer me to take thi glass in my hand and to go forth from your hous without further parlei or ha the greed of curios too much command of you think befor you answer for it shall be done as you decid as you decid you shall be left as you were befor and neither richer nor wiser unless the sens of servic render to a man in mortal distress mai be count as a kind of rich of the soul or if you shall so prefer to choos a new provinc of knowledg and new avenu to fame and power shall be laid open to you here in thi room upon the instant and your sight shall be blast by a prodigi to stagger the unbelief of satan sir said i affect a cool that i wa far from truli possess you speak enigma and you will perhap not wonder that i hear you with no veri strong impress of belief but i have gone too far in the wai of inexplic servic to paus befor i see the end it is well repli my visitor lanyon you rememb your vow what follow is under the seal of our profess and now you who have so long been bound to the most narrow and materi view you who have deni the virtu of transcendent medicin you who have derid your superior behold he put the glass to hi lip and drank at on gulp a cry follow he reel stagger clutch at the tabl and held on stare with inject ey gasp with open mouth and as i look there came i thought a chang he seem to swell hi face becam suddenli black and the featur seem to melt and alter and the next moment i had sprung to my feet and leap back against the wall my arm rais to shield me from that prodigi my mind submerg in terror o god i scream and o god again and again for there befor my ey pale and shaken and half faint and grope befor him with hi hand like a man restor from death there stood henri jekyl what he told me in the next hour i cannot bring my mind to set on paper i saw what i saw i heard what i heard and my soul sicken at it and yet now when that sight ha fade from my ey i ask myself if i believ it and i cannot answer my life is shaken to it root sleep ha left me the deadliest terror sit by me at all hour of the dai and night i feel that my dai ar number and that i must die and yet i shall die incredul as for the moral turpitud that man unveil to me even with tear of penit i cannot even in memori dwell on it without a start of horror i will sai but on thing utterson and that if you can bring your mind to credit it will be more than enough the creatur who crept into my hous that night wa on jekyl s own confess known by the name of hyde and hunt for in everi corner of the land as the murder of carew hasti lanyon henri jekyl s full statement of the case i wa born in the year to a larg fortun endow besid with excel part inclin by natur to industri fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellow men and thu as might have been suppos with everi guarante of an honour and distinguish futur and inde the worst of my fault wa a certain impati gaieti of disposit such as ha made the happi of mani but such as i found it hard to reconcil with my imperi desir to carri my head high and wear a more than commonli grave counten befor the public henc it came about that i conceal my pleasur and that when i reach year of reflect and began to look round me and take stock of my progress and posit in the world i stood alreadi commit to a profound duplic of life mani a man would have even blazon such irregular as i wa guilti of but from the high view that i had set befor me i regard and hid them with an almost morbid sens of shame it wa thu rather the exact natur of my aspir than ani particular degrad in my fault that made me what i wa and with even a deeper trench than in the major of men sever in me those provinc of good and ill which divid and compound man s dual natur in thi case i wa driven to reflect deepli and inveter on that hard law of life which li at the root of religion and is on of the most plenti spring of distress though so profound a doubl dealer i wa in no sens a hypocrit both side of me were in dead earnest i wa no more myself when i laid asid restraint and plung in shame than when i labour in the ey of dai at the further of knowledg or the relief of sorrow and suffer and it chanc that the direct of my scientif studi which led wholli toward the mystic and the transcendent re act and shed a strong light on thi conscious of the perenni war among my member with everi dai and from both side of my intellig the moral and the intellectu i thu drew steadili nearer to that truth by whose partial discoveri i have been doom to such a dread shipwreck that man is not truli on but truli two i sai two becaus the state of my own knowledg doe not pass beyond that point other will follow other will outstrip me on the same line and i hazard the guess that man will be ultim known for a mere politi of multifari incongru and independ denizen i for my part from the natur of my life advanc infal in on direct and in on direct onli it wa on the moral side and in my own person that i learn to recognis the thorough and primit dualiti of man i saw that of the two natur that contend in the field of my conscious even if i could rightli be said to be either it wa onli becaus i wa radic both and from an earli date even befor the cours of my scientif discoveri had begun to suggest the most nake possibl of such a miracl i had learn to dwell with pleasur as a belov dai dream on the thought of the separ of these element if each i told myself could but be hous in separ ident life would be reliev of all that wa unbear the unjust deliv from the aspir might go hi wai and remors of hi more upright twin and the just could walk steadfastli and secur on hi upward path do the good thing in which he found hi pleasur and no longer expos to disgrac and penit by the hand of thi extran evil it wa the curs of mankind that these incongru fagot were thu bound togeth that in the agonis womb of conscious these polar twin should be continu struggl how then were thei dissoci i wa so far in my reflect when as i have said a side light began to shine upon the subject from the laboratori tabl i began to perceiv more deepli than it ha ever yet been state the trembl immateri the mist like transienc of thi seemingli so solid bodi in which we walk attir certain agent i found to have the power to shake and to pluck back that fleshli vestment even as a wind might toss the curtain of a pavilion for two good reason i will not enter deepli into thi scientif branch of my confess first becaus i have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on man s shoulder and when the attempt is made to cast it off it but return upon us with more unfamiliar and more aw pressur second becaus as my narr will make ala too evid my discoveri were incomplet enough then that i not onli recognis my natur bodi for the mere aura and effulg of certain of the power that made up my spirit but manag to compound a drug by which these power should be dethron from their supremaci and a second form and counten substitut none the less natur to me becaus thei were the express and bore the stamp of lower element in my soul i hesit long befor i put thi theori to the test of practic i knew well that i risk death for ani drug that so potent control and shook the veri fortress of ident might by the least scrupl of an overdos or at the least inopportun in the moment of exhibit utterli blot out that immateri tabernacl which i look to it to chang but the temptat of a discoveri so singular and profound at last overcam the suggest of alarm i had long sinc prepar my tinctur i purchas at onc from a firm of wholesal chemist a larg quantiti of a particular salt which i knew from my experi to be the last ingredi requir and late on accurs night i compound the element watch them boil and smoke togeth in the glass and when the ebullit had subsid with a strong glow of courag drank off the potion the most rack pang succeed a grind in the bone deadli nausea and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceed at the hour of birth or death then these agoni began swiftli to subsid and i came to myself as if out of a great sick there wa someth strang in my sensat someth indescrib new and from it veri novelti incred sweet i felt younger lighter happier in bodi within i wa consciou of a headi reckless a current of disord sensual imag run like a mill race in my fanci a solut of the bond of oblig an unknown but not an innoc freedom of the soul i knew myself at the first breath of thi new life to be more wick tenfold more wick sold a slave to my origin evil and the thought in that moment brace and delight me like wine i stretch out my hand exult in the fresh of these sensat and in the act i wa suddenli awar that i had lost in statur there wa no mirror at that date in my room that which stand besid me as i write wa brought there later on and for the veri purpos of these transform the night howev wa far gone into the morn the morn black as it wa wa nearli ripe for the concept of the dai the inmat of my hous were lock in the most rigor hour of slumber and i determin flush as i wa with hope and triumph to ventur in my new shape as far as to my bedroom i cross the yard wherein the constel look down upon me i could have thought with wonder the first creatur of that sort that their unsleep vigil had yet disclos to them i stole through the corridor a stranger in my own hous and come to my room i saw for the first time the appear of edward hyde i must here speak by theori alon sai not that which i know but that which i suppos to be most probabl the evil side of my natur to which i had now transfer the stamp efficaci wa less robust and less develop than the good which i had just depos again in the cours of my life which had been after all nine tenth a life of effort virtu and control it had been much less exercis and much less exhaust and henc as i think it came about that edward hyde wa so much smaller slighter and younger than henri jekyl even as good shone upon the counten of the on evil wa written broadli and plainli on the face of the other evil besid which i must still believ to be the lethal side of man had left on that bodi an imprint of deform and decai and yet when i look upon that ugli idol in the glass i wa consciou of no repugn rather of a leap of welcom thi too wa myself it seem natur and human in my ey it bore a liveli imag of the spirit it seem more express and singl than the imperfect and divid counten i had been hitherto accustom to call mine and in so far i wa doubtless right i have observ that when i wore the semblanc of edward hyde none could come near to me at first without a visibl misgiv of the flesh thi as i take it wa becaus all human be as we meet them ar commingl out of good and evil and edward hyde alon in the rank of mankind wa pure evil i linger but a moment at the mirror the second and conclus experi had yet to be attempt it yet remain to be seen if i had lost my ident beyond redempt and must flee befor daylight from a hous that wa no longer mine and hurri back to my cabinet i onc more prepar and drank the cup onc more suffer the pang of dissolut and came to myself onc more with the charact the statur and the face of henri jekyl that night i had come to the fatal cross road had i approach my discoveri in a more nobl spirit had i risk the experi while under the empir of gener or piou aspir all must have been otherwis and from these agoni of death and birth i had come forth an angel instead of a fiend the drug had no discrimin action it wa neither diabol nor divin it but shook the door of the prison hous of my disposit and like the captiv of philippi that which stood within ran forth at that time my virtu slumber my evil kept awak by ambit wa alert and swift to seiz the occas and the thing that wa project wa edward hyde henc although i had now two charact as well as two appear on wa wholli evil and the other wa still the old henri jekyl that incongru compound of whose reform and improv i had alreadi learn to despair the movement wa thu wholli toward the wors even at that time i had not yet conquer my avers to the dryness of a life of studi i would still be merrili dispos at time and as my pleasur were to sai the least undignifi and i wa not onli well known and highli consid but grow toward the elderli man thi incoher of my life wa daili grow more unwelcom it wa on thi side that my new power tempt me until i fell in slaveri i had but to drink the cup to doff at onc the bodi of the note professor and to assum like a thick cloak that of edward hyde i smile at the notion it seem to me at the time to be humor and i made my prepar with the most studiou care i took and furnish that hous in soho to which hyde wa track by the polic and engag as housekeep a creatur whom i well knew to be silent and unscrupul on the other side i announc to my servant that a mr hyde whom i describ wa to have full liberti and power about my hous in the squar and to parri mishap i even call and made myself a familiar object in my second charact i next drew up that will to which you so much object so that if anyth befel me in the person of dr jekyl i could enter on that of edward hyde without pecuniari loss and thu fortifi as i suppos on everi side i began to profit by the strang immun of my posit men have befor hire bravo to transact their crime while their own person and reput sat under shelter i wa the first that ever did so for hi pleasur i wa the first that could thu plod in the public ey with a load of genial respect and in a moment like a schoolboi strip off these lend and spring headlong into the sea of liberti but for me in my impenetr mantl the safeti wa complet think of it i did not even exist let me but escap into my laboratori door give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that i had alwai stand readi and whatev he had done edward hyde would pass awai like the stain of breath upon a mirror and there in hi stead quietli at home trim the midnight lamp in hi studi a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion would be henri jekyl the pleasur which i made hast to seek in my disguis were as i have said undignifi i would scarc us a harder term but in the hand of edward hyde thei soon began to turn toward the monstrou when i would come back from these excurs i wa often plung into a kind of wonder at my vicari deprav thi familiar that i call out of my own soul and sent forth alon to do hi good pleasur wa a be inher malign and villain hi everi act and thought centr on self drink pleasur with bestial avid from ani degre of tortur to anoth relentless like a man of stone henri jekyl stood at time aghast befor the act of edward hyde but the situat wa apart from ordinari law and insidi relax the grasp of conscienc it wa hyde after all and hyde alon that wa guilti jekyl wa no wors he woke again to hi good qualiti seemingli unimpair he would even make hast where it wa possibl to undo the evil done by hyde and thu hi conscienc slumber into the detail of the infami at which i thu conniv for even now i can scarc grant that i commit it i have no design of enter i mean but to point out the warn and the success step with which my chastis approach i met with on accid which as it brought on no consequ i shall no more than mention an act of cruelti to a child arous against me the anger of a passer by whom i recognis the other dai in the person of your kinsman the doctor and the child s famili join him there were moment when i fear for my life and at last in order to pacifi their too just resent edward hyde had to bring them to the door and pai them in a chequ drawn in the name of henri jekyl but thi danger wa easili elimin from the futur by open an account at anoth bank in the name of edward hyde himself and when by slope my own hand backward i had suppli my doubl with a signatur i thought i sat beyond the reach of fate some two month befor the murder of sir danver i had been out for on of my adventur had return at a late hour and woke the next dai in bed with somewhat odd sensat it wa in vain i look about me in vain i saw the decent furnitur and tall proport of my room in the squar in vain that i recognis the pattern of the bed curtain and the design of the mahogani frame someth still kept insist that i wa not where i wa that i had not waken where i seem to be but in the littl room in soho where i wa accustom to sleep in the bodi of edward hyde i smile to myself and in my psycholog wai began lazili to inquir into the element of thi illus occasion even as i did so drop back into a comfort morn doze i wa still so engag when in on of my more wake moment my ey fell upon my hand now the hand of henri jekyl as you have often remark wa profession in shape and size it wa larg firm white and come but the hand which i now saw clearli enough in the yellow light of a mid london morn ly half shut on the bed cloth wa lean cord knuckli of a duski pallor and thickli shade with a swart growth of hair it wa the hand of edward hyde i must have stare upon it for near half a minut sunk as i wa in the mere stupid of wonder befor terror woke up in my breast as sudden and startl as the crash of cymbal and bound from my bed i rush to the mirror at the sight that met my ey my blood wa chang into someth exquisit thin and ici ye i had gone to bed henri jekyl i had awaken edward hyde how wa thi to be explain i ask myself and then with anoth bound of terror how wa it to be remedi it wa well on in the morn the servant were up all my drug were in the cabinet a long journei down two pair of stair through the back passag across the open court and through the anatom theatr from where i wa then stand horror struck it might inde be possibl to cover my face but of what us wa that when i wa unabl to conceal the alter in my statur and then with an overpow sweet of relief it came back upon my mind that the servant were alreadi us to the come and go of my second self i had soon dress as well as i wa abl in cloth of my own size had soon pass through the hous where bradshaw stare and drew back at see mr hyde at such an hour and in such a strang arrai and ten minut later dr jekyl had return to hi own shape and wa sit down with a darken brow to make a feint of breakfast small inde wa my appetit thi inexplic incid thi revers of my previou experi seem like the babylonian finger on the wall to be spell out the letter of my judgment and i began to reflect more serious than ever befor on the issu and possibl of my doubl exist that part of me which i had the power of project had late been much exercis and nourish it had seem to me of late as though the bodi of edward hyde had grown in statur as though when i wore that form i were consciou of a more gener tide of blood and i began to spy a danger that if thi were much prolong the balanc of my natur might be perman overthrown the power of voluntari chang be forfeit and the charact of edward hyde becom irrevoc mine the power of the drug had not been alwai equal displai onc veri earli in my career it had total fail me sinc then i had been oblig on more than on occas to doubl and onc with infinit risk of death to trebl the amount and these rare uncertainti had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my content now howev and in the light of that morn s accid i wa led to remark that wherea in the begin the difficulti had been to throw off the bodi of jekyl it had of late gradual but decidedli transfer itself to the other side all thing therefor seem to point to thi that i wa slowli lose hold of my origin and better self and becom slowli incorpor with my second and wors between these two i now felt i had to choos my two natur had memori in common but all other faculti were most unequ share between them jekyl who wa composit now with the most sensit apprehens now with a greedi gusto project and share in the pleasur and adventur of hyde but hyde wa indiffer to jekyl or but rememb him as the mountain bandit rememb the cavern in which he conceal himself from pursuit jekyl had more than a father s interest hyde had more than a son s indiffer to cast in my lot with jekyl wa to die to those appetit which i had long secretli indulg and had of late begun to pamper to cast it in with hyde wa to die to a thousand interest and aspir and to becom at a blow and for ever despis and friendless the bargain might appear unequ but there wa still anoth consider in the scale for while jekyl would suffer smartingli in the fire of abstin hyde would be not even consciou of all that he had lost strang as my circumst were the term of thi debat ar as old and commonplac as man much the same induc and alarm cast the die for ani tempt and trembl sinner and it fell out with me as it fall with so vast a major of my fellow that i chose the better part and wa found want in the strength to keep to it ye i prefer the elderli and discont doctor surround by friend and cherish honest hope and bade a resolut farewel to the liberti the compar youth the light step leap impuls and secret pleasur that i had enjoi in the disguis of hyde i made thi choic perhap with some unconsci reserv for i neither gave up the hous in soho nor destroi the cloth of edward hyde which still lai readi in my cabinet for two month howev i wa true to my determin for two month i led a life of such sever as i had never befor attain to and enjoi the compens of an approv conscienc but time began at last to obliter the fresh of my alarm the prais of conscienc began to grow into a thing of cours i began to be tortur with throe and long as of hyde struggl after freedom and at last in an hour of moral weak i onc again compound and swallow the transform draught i do not suppos that when a drunkard reason with himself upon hi vice he is onc out of five hundr time affect by the danger that he run through hi brutish physic insens neither had i long as i had consid my posit made enough allow for the complet moral insens and insens readi to evil which were the lead charact of edward hyde yet it wa by these that i wa punish my devil had been long cage he came out roar i wa consciou even when i took the draught of a more unbridl a more furiou propens to ill it must have been thi i suppos that stir in my soul that tempest of impati with which i listen to the civil of my unhappi victim i declar at least befor god no man moral sane could have been guilti of that crime upon so piti a provoc and that i struck in no more reason spirit than that in which a sick child mai break a playth but i had voluntarili strip myself of all those balanc instinct by which even the worst of us continu to walk with some degre of steadi among temptat and in my case to be tempt howev slightli wa to fall instantli the spirit of hell awok in me and rage with a transport of glee i maul the unresist bodi tast delight from everi blow and it wa not till weari had begun to succe that i wa suddenli in the top fit of my delirium struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror a mist dispers i saw my life to be forfeit and fled from the scene of these excess at onc glori and trembl my lust of evil gratifi and stimul my love of life screw to the topmost peg i ran to the hous in soho and to make assur doubli sure destroi my paper thenc i set out through the lamplit street in the same divid ecstasi of mind gloat on my crime light headedli devis other in the futur and yet still hasten and still hearken in my wake for the step of the aveng hyde had a song upon hi lip as he compound the draught and as he drank it pledg the dead man the pang of transform had not done tear him befor henri jekyl with stream tear of gratitud and remors had fallen upon hi knee and lift hi clasp hand to god the veil of self indulg wa rent from head to foot i saw my life as a whole i follow it up from the dai of childhood when i had walk with my father s hand and through the self deni toil of my profession life to arriv again and again with the same sens of unreal at the damn horror of the even i could have scream aloud i sought with tear and prayer to smother down the crowd of hideou imag and sound with which my memori swarm against me and still between the petit the ugli face of my iniqu stare into my soul as the acut of thi remors began to die awai it wa succeed by a sens of joi the problem of my conduct wa solv hyde wa thenceforth imposs whether i would or not i wa now confin to the better part of my exist and oh how i rejoic to think it with what will humil i embrac anew the restrict of natur life with what sincer renunci i lock the door by which i had so often gone and come and ground the kei under my heel the next dai came the new that the murder had been overlook that the guilt of hyde wa patent to the world and that the victim wa a man high in public estim it wa not onli a crime it had been a tragic folli i think i wa glad to know it i think i wa glad to have my better impuls thu buttress and guard by the terror of the scaffold jekyl wa now my citi of refug let but hyde peep out an instant and the hand of all men would be rais to take and slai him i resolv in my futur conduct to redeem the past and i can sai with honesti that my resolv wa fruit of some good you know yourself how earnestli in the last month of last year i labour to reliev suffer you know that much wa done for other and that the dai pass quietli almost happili for myself nor can i truli sai that i weari of thi benefic and innoc life i think instead that i daili enjoi it more complet but i wa still curs with my dualiti of purpos and as the first edg of my penit wore off the lower side of me so long indulg so recent chain down began to growl for licenc not that i dream of resuscit hyde the bare idea of that would startl me to frenzi no it wa in my own person that i wa onc more tempt to trifl with my conscienc and it wa as an ordinari secret sinner that i at last fell befor the assault of temptat there come an end to all thing the most capaci measur is fill at last and thi brief condescens to evil final destroi the balanc of my soul and yet i wa not alarm the fall seem natur like a return to the old dai befor i had made discoveri it wa a fine clear januari dai wet under foot where the frost had melt but cloudless overhead and the regent s park wa full of winter chirrup and sweet with spring odour i sat in the sun on a bench the anim within me lick the chop of memori the spiritu side a littl drows promis subsequ penit but not yet move to begin after all i reflect i wa like my neighbour and then i smile compar myself with other men compar my activ goodwil with the lazi cruelti of their neglect and at the veri moment of that vain gloriou thought a qualm came over me a horrid nausea and the most deadli shudder these pass awai and left me faint and then as in it turn the faint subsid i began to be awar of a chang in the temper of my thought a greater bold a contempt of danger a solut of the bond of oblig i look down my cloth hung formlessli on my shrunken limb the hand that lai on my knee wa cord and hairi i wa onc more edward hyde a moment befor i had been safe of all men s respect wealthi belov the cloth lai for me in the dine room at home and now i wa the common quarri of mankind hunt houseless a known murder thrall to the gallow my reason waver but it did not fail me utterli i have more than onc observ that in my second charact my faculti seem sharpen to a point and my spirit more tens elast thu it came about that where jekyl perhap might have succumb hyde rose to the import of the moment my drug were in on of the press of my cabinet how wa i to reach them that wa the problem that crush my templ in my hand i set myself to solv the laboratori door i had close if i sought to enter by the hous my own servant would consign me to the gallow i saw i must emploi anoth hand and thought of lanyon how wa he to be reach how persuad suppos that i escap captur in the street how wa i to make my wai into hi presenc and how should i an unknown and displeas visitor prevail on the famou physician to rifl the studi of hi colleagu dr jekyl then i rememb that of my origin charact on part remain to me i could write my own hand and onc i had conceiv that kindl spark the wai that i must follow becam light up from end to end thereupon i arrang my cloth as best i could and summon a pass hansom drove to an hotel in portland street the name of which i chanc to rememb at my appear which wa inde comic enough howev tragic a fate these garment cover the driver could not conceal hi mirth i gnash my teeth upon him with a gust of devilish furi and the smile wither from hi face happili for him yet more happili for myself for in anoth instant i had certainli drag him from hi perch at the inn as i enter i look about me with so black a counten as made the attend trembl not a look did thei exchang in my presenc but obsequi took my order led me to a privat room and brought me wherewith to write hyde in danger of hi life wa a creatur new to me shaken with inordin anger strung to the pitch of murder lust to inflict pain yet the creatur wa astut master hi furi with a great effort of the will compos hi two import letter on to lanyon and on to pool and that he might receiv actual evid of their be post sent them out with direct that thei should be regist thenceforward he sat all dai over the fire in the privat room gnaw hi nail there he dine sit alon with hi fear the waiter visibl quail befor hi ey and thenc when the night wa fulli come he set forth in the corner of a close cab and wa driven to and fro about the street of the citi he i sai i cannot sai i that child of hell had noth human noth live in him but fear and hatr and when at last think the driver had begun to grow suspici he discharg the cab and ventur on foot attir in hi misfit cloth an object mark out for observ into the midst of the nocturn passeng these two base passion rage within him like a tempest he walk fast hunt by hi fear chatter to himself skulk through the less frequent thoroughfar count the minut that still divid him from midnight onc a woman spoke to him offer i think a box of light he smote her in the face and she fled when i came to myself at lanyon s the horror of my old friend perhap affect me somewhat i do not know it wa at least but a drop in the sea to the abhorr with which i look back upon these hour a chang had come over me it wa no longer the fear of the gallow it wa the horror of be hyde that rack me i receiv lanyon s condemn partli in a dream it wa partli in a dream that i came home to my own hous and got into bed i slept after the prostrat of the dai with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmar that wrung me could avail to break i awok in the morn shaken weaken but refresh i still hate and fear the thought of the brute that slept within me and i had not of cours forgotten the appal danger of the dai befor but i wa onc more at home in my own hous and close to my drug and gratitud for my escap shone so strong in my soul that it almost rival the bright of hope i wa step leisur across the court after breakfast drink the chill of the air with pleasur when i wa seiz again with those indescrib sensat that herald the chang and i had but the time to gain the shelter of my cabinet befor i wa onc again rage and freez with the passion of hyde it took on thi occas a doubl dose to recal me to myself and ala six hour after as i sat look sadli in the fire the pang return and the drug had to be re administ in short from that dai forth it seem onli by a great effort as of gymnast and onli under the immedi stimul of the drug that i wa abl to wear the counten of jekyl at all hour of the dai and night i would be taken with the premonitori shudder abov all if i slept or even doze for a moment in my chair it wa alwai as hyde that i awaken under the strain of thi continu impend doom and by the sleepless to which i now condemn myself ay even beyond what i had thought possibl to man i becam in my own person a creatur eaten up and empti by fever languidli weak both in bodi and mind and sole occupi by on thought the horror of my other self but when i slept or when the virtu of the medicin wore off i would leap almost without transit for the pang of transform grew daili less mark into the possess of a fanci brim with imag of terror a soul boil with causeless hatr and a bodi that seem not strong enough to contain the rage energi of life the power of hyde seem to have grown with the sickli of jekyl and certainli the hate that now divid them wa equal on each side with jekyl it wa a thing of vital instinct he had now seen the full deform of that creatur that share with him some of the phenomena of conscious and wa co heir with him to death and beyond these link of commun which in themselv made the most poignant part of hi distress he thought of hyde for all hi energi of life as of someth not onli hellish but inorgan thi wa the shock thing that the slime of the pit seem to utter cri and voic that the amorph dust gesticul and sin that what wa dead and had no shape should usurp the offic of life and thi again that that insurg horror wa knit to him closer than a wife closer than an ey lai cage in hi flesh where he heard it mutter and felt it struggl to be born and at everi hour of weak and in the confid of slumber prevail against him and depos him out of life the hatr of hyde for jekyl wa of a differ order hi terror of the gallow drove him continu to commit temporari suicid and return to hi subordin station of a part instead of a person but he loath the necess he loath the despond into which jekyl wa now fallen and he resent the dislik with which he wa himself regard henc the ap like trick that he would plai me scrawl in my own hand blasphemi on the page of my book burn the letter and destroi the portrait of my father and inde had it not been for hi fear of death he would long ago have ruin himself in order to involv me in the ruin but hi love of life is wonder i go further i who sicken and freez at the mere thought of him when i recal the abject and passion of thi attach and when i know how he fear my power to cut him off by suicid i find it in my heart to piti him it is useless and the time awfulli fail me to prolong thi descript no on ha ever suffer such torment let that suffic and yet even to these habit brought no not allevi but a certain callous of soul a certain acquiesc of despair and my punish might have gone on for year but for the last calam which ha now fallen and which ha final sever me from my own face and natur my provis of the salt which had never been renew sinc the date of the first experi began to run low i sent out for a fresh suppli and mix the draught the ebullit follow and the first chang of colour not the second i drank it and it wa without effici you will learn from pool how i have had london ransack it wa in vain and i am now persuad that my first suppli wa impur and that it wa that unknown impur which lent efficaci to the draught about a week ha pass and i am now finish thi statement under the influenc of the last of the old powder thi then is the last time short of a miracl that henri jekyl can think hi own thought or see hi own face now how sadli alter in the glass nor must i delai too long to bring my write to an end for if my narr ha hitherto escap destruct it ha been by a combin of great prudenc and great good luck should the throe of chang take me in the act of write it hyde will tear it in piec but if some time shall have elaps after i have laid it by hi wonder selfish and circumscript to the moment will probabl save it onc again from the action of hi ap like spite and inde the doom that is close on us both ha alreadi chang and crush him half an hour from now when i shall again and for ever re indu that hate person i know how i shall sit shudder and weep in my chair or continu with the most strain and fear struck ecstasi of listen to pace up and down thi room my last earthli refug and give ear to everi sound of menac will hyde die upon the scaffold or will he find courag to releas himself at the last moment god know i am careless thi is my true hour of death and what is to follow concern anoth than myself here then as i lai down the pen and proce to seal up my confess i bring the life of that unhappi henri jekyl to an end
