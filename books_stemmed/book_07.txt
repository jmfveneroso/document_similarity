mr lemuel gulliv is my ancient and intim friend there is likewis some relat between us on the mother s side about three year ago mr gulliv grow weari of the concours of curiou peopl come to him at hi hous in redriff made a small purchas of land with a conveni hous near newark in nottinghamshir hi nativ countri where he now live retir yet in good esteem among hi neighbour although mr gulliv wa born in nottinghamshir where hi father dwelt yet i have heard him sai hi famili came from oxfordshir to confirm which i have observ in the churchyard at banburi in that counti sever tomb and monument of the gulliv befor he quit redriff he left the custodi of the follow paper in my hand with the liberti to dispos of them as i should think fit i have carefulli perus them three time the style is veri plain and simpl and the onli fault i find is that the author after the manner of travel is a littl too circumstanti there is an air of truth appar through the whole and inde the author wa so distinguish for hi verac that it becam a sort of proverb among hi neighbour at redriff when ani on affirm a thing to sai it wa as true as if mr gulliv had spoken it by the advic of sever worthi person to whom with the author s permiss i commun these paper i now ventur to send them into the world hope thei mai be at least for some time a better entertain to our young noblemen than the common scribbl of polit and parti thi volum would have been at least twice as larg if i had not made bold to strike out innumer passag relat to the wind and tide as well as to the variat and bear in the sever voyag togeth with the minut descript of the manag of the ship in storm in the style of sailor likewis the account of longitud and latitud wherein i have reason to apprehend that mr gulliv mai be a littl dissatisfi but i wa resolv to fit the work as much as possibl to the gener capac of reader howev if my own ignor in sea affair shall have led me to commit some mistak i alon am answer for them and if ani travel hath a curios to see the whole work at larg as it came from the hand of the author i will be readi to gratifi him as for ani further particular relat to the author the reader will receiv satisfact from the first page of the book richard sympson a letter from captain gulliv to hi cousin sympson written in the year i hope you will be readi to own publicli whenev you shall be call to it that by your great and frequent urgenc you prevail on me to publish a veri loos and uncorrect account of my travel with direct to hire some young gentleman of either univers to put them in order and correct the style as my cousin dampier did by my advic in hi book call a voyag round the world but i do not rememb i gave you power to consent that ani thing should be omit and much less that ani thing should be insert therefor as to the latter i do here renounc everi thing of that kind particularli a paragraph about her majesti queen ann of most piou and gloriou memori although i did rever and esteem her more than ani of human speci but you or your interpol ought to have consid that it wa not my inclin so wa it not decent to prais ani anim of our composit befor my master houyhnhnm and besid the fact wa altogeth fals for to my knowledg be in england dure some part of her majesti s reign she did govern by a chief minist nai even by two success the first whereof wa the lord of godolphin and the second the lord of oxford so that you have made me sai the thing that wa not likewis in the account of the academi of projector and sever passag of my discours to my master houyhnhnm you have either omit some materi circumst or minc or chang them in such a manner that i do hardli know my own work when i formerli hint to you someth of thi in a letter you were pleas to answer that you were afraid of give offenc that peopl in power were veri watch over the press and apt not onli to interpret but to punish everi thing which look like an innuendo as i think you call it but prai how could that which i spoke so mani year ago and at about five thousand leagu distanc in anoth reign be appli to ani of the yahoo who now ar said to govern the herd especi at a time when i littl thought or fear the unhappi of live under them have not i the most reason to complain when i see these veri yahoo carri by houyhnhnm in a vehicl as if thei were brute and those the ration creatur and inde to avoid so monstrou and detest a sight wa on princip motiv of my retir hither thu much i thought proper to tell you in relat to yourself and to the trust i repos in you i do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgment in be prevail upon by the entreati and fals reason of you and some other veri much against my own opinion to suffer my travel to be publish prai bring to your mind how often i desir you to consid when you insist on the motiv of public good that the yahoo were a speci of anim utterli incap of amend by precept or exampl and so it ha prove for instead of see a full stop put to all abus and corrupt at least in thi littl island as i had reason to expect behold after abov six month warn i cannot learn that my book ha produc on singl effect accord to my intent i desir you would let me know by a letter when parti and faction were extinguish judg learn and upright pleader honest and modest with some tinctur of common sens and smithfield blaze with pyramid of law book the young nobil s educ entir chang the physician banish the femal yahoo abound in virtu honour truth and good sens court and leve of great minist thoroughli weed and swept wit merit and learn reward all disgrac of the press in prose and vers condemn to eat noth but their own cotton and quench their thirst with their own ink these and a thousand other reform i firmli count upon by your encourag as inde thei were plainli deduc from the precept deliv in my book and it must be own that seven month were a suffici time to correct everi vice and folli to which yahoo ar subject if their natur had been capabl of the least disposit to virtu or wisdom yet so far have you been from answer my expect in ani of your letter that on the contrari you ar load our carrier everi week with libel and kei and reflect and memoir and second part wherein i see myself accus of reflect upon great state folk of degrad human natur for so thei have still the confid to style it and of abus the femal sex i find likewis that the writer of those bundl ar not agre among themselv for some of them will not allow me to be the author of my own travel and other make me author of book to which i am wholli a stranger i find likewis that your printer ha been so careless as to confound the time and mistak the date of my sever voyag and return neither assign the true year nor the true month nor dai of the month and i hear the origin manuscript is all destroi sinc the public of my book neither have i ani copi left howev i have sent you some correct which you mai insert if ever there should be a second edit and yet i cannot stand to them but shall leav that matter to my judici and candid reader to adjust it as thei pleas i hear some of our sea yahoo find fault with my sea languag as not proper in mani part nor now in us i cannot help it in my first voyag while i wa young i wa instruct by the oldest marin and learn to speak as thei did but i have sinc found that the sea yahoo ar apt like the land on to becom new fangl in their word which the latter chang everi year insomuch as i rememb upon each return to my own countri their old dialect wa so alter that i could hardli understand the new and i observ when ani yahoo come from london out of curios to visit me at my hous we neither of us ar abl to deliv our concept in a manner intellig to the other if the censur of the yahoo could ani wai affect me i should have great reason to complain that some of them ar so bold as to think my book of travel a mere fiction out of mine own brain and have gone so far as to drop hint that the houyhnhnm and yahoo have no more exist than the inhabit of utopia inde i must confess that as to the peopl of lilliput brobdingrag for so the word should have been spelt and not erron brobdingnag and laputa i have never yet heard of ani yahoo so presumptu as to disput their be or the fact i have relat concern them becaus the truth immedi strike everi reader with convict and is there less probabl in my account of the houyhnhnm or yahoo when it is manifest as to the latter there ar so mani thousand even in thi countri who onli differ from their brother brute in houyhnhnmland becaus thei us a sort of jabber and do not go nake i wrote for their amend and not their approb the unit prais of the whole race would be of less consequ to me than the neigh of those two degener houyhnhnm i keep in my stabl becaus from these degener as thei ar i still improv in some virtu without ani mixtur of vice do these miser anim presum to think that i am so degener as to defend my verac yahoo as i am it is well known through all houyhnhnmland that by the instruct and exampl of my illustri master i wa abl in the compass of two year although i confess with the utmost difficulti to remov that infern habit of ly shuffl deceiv and equivoc so deepli root in the veri soul of all my speci especi the european i have other complaint to make upon thi vexati occas but i forbear troubl myself or you ani further i must freeli confess that sinc my last return some corrupt of my yahoo natur have reviv in me by convers with a few of your speci and particularli those of my own famili by an unavoid necess els i should never have attempt so absurd a project as that of reform the yahoo race in thi kingdom but i have now done with all such visionari scheme for ever april part i a voyag to lilliput chapter i the

among my brethren have therefor consult with my wife and some of my acquaint i determin to go again to sea i wa surgeon success in two ship and made sever voyag for six year to the east and west indi by which i got some addit to my fortun my hour of leisur i spent in read the best author ancient and modern be alwai provid with a good number of book and when i wa ashor in observ the manner and disposit of the peopl as well as learn their languag wherein i had a great facil by the strength of my memori the last of these voyag not prove veri fortun i grew weari of the sea and intend to stai at home with my wife and famili i remov from the old jewri to fetter lane and from thenc to wap hope to get busi among the sailor but it would not turn to account after three year expect that thing would mend i accept an advantag offer from captain william prichard master of the antelop who wa make a voyag to the south sea we set sail from bristol mai and our voyag wa at first veri prosper it would not be proper for some reason to troubl the reader with the particular of our adventur in those sea let it suffic to inform him that in our passag from thenc to the east indi we were driven by a violent storm to the north west of van diemen s land by an observ we found ourselv in the latitud of degre minut south twelv of our crew were dead by immoder labour and ill food the rest were in a veri weak condit on the th of novemb which wa the begin of summer in those part the weather be veri hazi the seamen spi a rock within half a cabl s length of the ship but the wind wa so strong that we were driven directli upon it and immedi split six of the crew of whom i wa on have let down the boat into the sea made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock we row by my comput about three leagu till we were abl to work no longer be alreadi spent with labour while we were in the ship we therefor trust ourselv to the merci of the wave and in about half an hour the boat wa overset by a sudden flurri from the north what becam of my companion in the boat as well as of those who escap on the rock or were left in the vessel i cannot tell but conclud thei were all lost for my own part i swam as fortun direct me and wa push forward by wind and tide i often let my leg drop and could feel no bottom but when i wa almost gone and abl to struggl no longer i found myself within my depth and by thi time the storm wa much abat the decliv wa so small that i walk near a mile befor i got to the shore which i conjectur wa about eight o clock in the even i then advanc forward near half a mile but could not discov ani sign of hous or inhabit at least i wa in so weak a condit that i did not observ them i wa extrem tire and with that and the heat of the weather and about half a pint of brandi that i drank as i left the ship i found myself much inclin to sleep i lai down on the grass which wa veri short and soft where i slept sounder than ever i rememb to have done in my life and as i reckon about nine hour for when i awak it wa just dai light i attempt to rise but wa not abl to stir for as i happen to lie on my back i found my arm and leg were strongli fasten on each side to the ground and my hair which wa long and thick ti down in the same manner i likewis felt sever slender ligatur across my bodi from my arm pit to my thigh i could onli look upward the sun began to grow hot and the light offend my ey i heard a confus nois about me but in the postur i lai could see noth except the sky in a littl time i felt someth aliv move on my left leg which advanc gentli forward over my breast came almost up to my chin when bend my ey downward as much as i could i perceiv it to be a human creatur not six inch high with a bow and arrow in hi hand and a quiver at hi back in the mean time i felt at least forti more of the same kind as i conjectur follow the first i wa in the utmost astonish and roar so loud that thei all ran back in a fright and some of them as i wa afterward told were hurt with the fall thei got by leap from my side upon the ground howev thei soon return and on of them who ventur so far as to get a full sight of my face lift up hi hand and ey by wai of admir cri out in a shrill but distinct voic hekinah degul the other repeat the same word sever time but then i knew not what thei meant i lai all thi while as the reader mai believ in great uneasi at length struggl to get loos i had the fortun to break the string and wrench out the peg that fasten my left arm to the ground for by lift it up to my face i discov the method thei had taken to bind me and at the same time with a violent pull which gave me excess pain i a littl loosen the string that ti down my hair on the left side so that i wa just abl to turn my head about two inch but the creatur ran off a second time befor i could seiz them whereupon there wa a great shout in a veri shrill accent and after it ceas i heard on of them cry aloud tolgo phonac when in an instant i felt abov a hundr arrow discharg on my left hand which prick me like so mani needl and besid thei shot anoth flight into the air as we do bomb in europ whereof mani i suppos fell on my bodi though i felt them not and some on my face which i immedi cover with my left hand when thi shower of arrow wa over i fell a groan with grief and pain and then strive again to get loos thei discharg anoth vollei larger than the first and some of them attempt with spear to stick me in the side but by good luck i had on a buff jerkin which thei could not pierc i thought it the most prudent method to lie still and my design wa to continu so till night when my left hand be alreadi loos i could easili free myself and as for the inhabit i had reason to believ i might be a match for the greatest armi thei could bring against me if thei were all of the same size with him that i saw but fortun dispos otherwis of me when the peopl observ i wa quiet thei discharg no more arrow but by the nois i heard i knew their number increas and about four yard from me over against my right ear i heard a knock for abov an hour like that of peopl at work when turn my head that wai as well as the peg and string would permit me i saw a stage erect about a foot and a half from the ground capabl of hold four of the inhabit with two or three ladder to mount it from whenc on of them who seem to be a person of qualiti made me a long speech whereof i understood not on syllabl but i should have mention that befor the princip person began hi orat he cri out three time langro dehul san these word and the former were afterward repeat and explain to me whereupon immedi about fifti of the inhabit came and cut the string that fasten the left side of my head which gave me the liberti of turn it to the right and of observ the person and gestur of him that wa to speak he appear to be of a middl ag and taller than ani of the other three who attend him whereof on wa a page that held up hi train and seem to be somewhat longer than my middl finger the other two stood on on each side to support him he act everi part of an orat and i could observ mani period of threaten and other of promis piti and kind i answer in a few word but in the most submiss manner lift up my left hand and both my ey to the sun as call him for a wit and be almost famish with hunger have not eaten a morsel for some hour befor i left the ship i found the demand of natur so strong upon me that i could not forbear show my impati perhap against the strict rule of decenc by put my finger frequent to my mouth to signifi that i want food the hurgo for so thei call a great lord as i afterward learnt understood me veri well he descend from the stage and command that sever ladder should be appli to my side on which abov a hundr of the inhabit mount and walk toward my mouth laden with basket full of meat which had been provid and sent thither by the king s order upon the first intellig he receiv of me i observ there wa the flesh of sever anim but could not distinguish them by the tast there were shoulder leg and loin shape like those of mutton and veri well dress but smaller than the wing of a lark i at them by two or three at a mouth and took three loav at a time about the big of musket bullet thei suppli me as fast as thei could show a thousand mark of wonder and astonish at my bulk and appetit i then made anoth sign that i want drink thei found by my eat that a small quantiti would not suffic me and be a most ingeni peopl thei slung up with great dexter on of their largest hogshead then roll it toward my hand and beat out the top i drank it off at a draught which i might well do for it did not hold half a pint and tast like a small wine of burgundi but much more delici thei brought me a second hogshead which i drank in the same manner and made sign for more but thei had none to give me when i had perform these wonder thei shout for joi and danc upon my breast repeat sever time as thei did at first hekinah degul thei made me a sign that i should throw down the two hogshead but first warn the peopl below to stand out of the wai cry aloud borach mevolah and when thei saw the vessel in the air there wa a univers shout of hekinah degul i confess i wa often tempt while thei were pass backward and forward on my bodi to seiz forti or fifti of the first that came in my reach and dash them against the ground but the remembr of what i had felt which probabl might not be the worst thei could do and the promis of honour i made them for so i interpret my submiss behaviour soon drove out these imagin besid i now consid myself as bound by the law of hospit to a peopl who had treat me with so much expens and magnific howev in my thought i could not suffici wonder at the intrepid of these diminut mortal who durst ventur to mount and walk upon my bodi while on of my hand wa at liberti without trembl at the veri sight of so prodigi a creatur as i must appear to them after some time when thei observ that i made no more demand for meat there appear befor me a person of high rank from hi imperi majesti hi excel have mount on the small of my right leg advanc forward up to my face with about a dozen of hi retinu and produc hi credenti under the signet royal which he appli close to my ey spoke about ten minut without ani sign of anger but with a kind of determin resolut often point forward which as i afterward found wa toward the capit citi about half a mile distant whither it wa agre by hi majesti in council that i must be convei i answer in few word but to no purpos and made a sign with my hand that wa loos put it to the other but over hi excel s head for fear of hurt him or hi train and then to my own head and bodi to signifi that i desir my liberti it appear that he understood me well enough for he shook hi head by wai of disapprob and held hi hand in a postur to show that i must be carri as a prison howev he made other sign to let me understand that i should have meat and drink enough and veri good treatment whereupon i onc more thought of attempt to break my bond but again when i felt the smart of their arrow upon my face and hand which were all in blister and mani of the dart still stick in them and observ likewis that the number of my enemi increas i gave token to let them know that thei might do with me what thei pleas upon thi the hurgo and hi train withdrew with much civil and cheer counten soon after i heard a gener shout with frequent repetit of the word peplom selan and i felt great number of peopl on my left side relax the cord to such a degre that i wa abl to turn upon my right and to eas myself with make water which i veri plentifulli did to the great astonish of the peopl who conjectur by my motion what i wa go to do immedi open to the right and left on that side to avoid the torrent which fell with such nois and violenc from me but befor thi thei had daub my face and both my hand with a sort of ointment veri pleasant to the smell which in a few minut remov all the smart of their arrow these circumst ad to the refresh i had receiv by their victual and drink which were veri nourish dispos me to sleep i slept about eight hour as i wa afterward assur and it wa no wonder for the physician by the emperor s order had mingl a sleepi potion in the hogshead of wine it seem that upon the first moment i wa discov sleep on the ground after my land the emperor had earli notic of it by an express and determin in council that i should be ti in the manner i have relat which wa done in the night while i slept that plenti of meat and drink should be sent to me and a machin prepar to carri me to the capit citi thi resolut perhap mai appear veri bold and danger and i am confid would not be imit by ani princ in europ on the like occas howev in my opinion it wa extrem prudent as well as gener for suppos these peopl had endeavour to kill me with their spear and arrow while i wa asleep i should certainli have awak with the first sens of smart which might so far have rous my rage and strength as to have enabl me to break the string wherewith i wa ti after which as thei were not abl to make resist so thei could expect no merci these peopl ar most excel mathematician and arriv to a great perfect in mechan by the counten and encourag of the emperor who is a renown patron of learn thi princ ha sever machin fix on wheel for the

upon twenti two wheel the shout i heard wa upon the arriv of thi engin which it seem set out in four hour after my land it wa brought parallel to me as i lai but the princip difficulti wa to rais and place me in thi vehicl eighti pole each of on foot high were erect for thi purpos and veri strong cord of the big of packthread were fasten by hook to mani bandag which the workmen had girt round my neck my hand my bodi and my leg nine hundr of the strongest men were emploi to draw up these cord by mani pullei fasten on the pole and thu in less than three hour i wa rais and slung into the engin and there ti fast all thi i wa told for while the oper wa perform i lai in a profound sleep by the forc of that soporifer medicin infus into my liquor fifteen hundr of the emperor s largest hors each about four inch and a half high were emploi to draw me toward the metropoli which as i said wa half a mile distant about four hour after we began our journei i awak by a veri ridicul accid for the carriag be stop a while to adjust someth that wa out of order two or three of the young nativ had the curios to see how i look when i wa asleep thei climb up into the engin and advanc veri softli to my face on of them an offic in the guard put the sharp end of hi half pike a good wai up into my left nostril which tickl my nose like a straw and made me sneez violent whereupon thei stole off unperceiv and it wa three week befor i knew the caus of my wake so suddenli we made a long march the remain part of the dai and rest at night with five hundr guard on each side of me half with torch and half with bow and arrow readi to shoot me if i should offer to stir the next morn at sun rise we continu our march and arriv within two hundr yard of the citi gate about noon the emperor and all hi court came out to meet us but hi great offic would by no mean suffer hi majesti to endang hi person by mount on my bodi at the place where the carriag stop there stood an ancient templ esteem to be

high here the emperor ascend with mani princip lord of hi court to have an opportun of view me as i wa told for i could not see them it wa reckon that abov a hundr thousand inhabit came out of the town upon the same errand and in spite of my guard i believ there could not be fewer than ten thousand at sever time who mount my bodi by the help of ladder but a proclam wa soon issu to forbid it upon pain of death when the workmen found it wa imposs for me to break loos thei cut all the string that bound me whereupon i rose up with as melancholi a disposit as ever i had in my life but the nois and astonish of the peopl at see me rise and walk ar not to be express the chain that held my left leg were about two yard long and gave me not onli the liberti of walk backward and forward in a

i found myself on my feet i look about me and must confess i never beheld a more entertain prospect the countri around appear like a continu garden and the enclos field which were gener forti feet squar resembl so mani bed of flower these field were intermingl with wood of half a stang and the tallest tree as i could judg appear to be seven feet high i view the town on my left hand which look like the paint scene of a citi in a theatr i had been for some hour extrem press by the necess of natur which wa no wonder it be almost two dai sinc i had last disburden myself i wa under great difficulti between urgenc and shame the best expedi i could think of wa to creep into my hous which i accordingli did and shut the gate after me i went as far as the length of my chain would suffer and discharg my bodi of that uneasi load but thi wa the onli time i wa ever guilti of so uncleanli an action for which i cannot but hope the candid reader will give some allow after he ha matur and imparti consid my case and the distress i wa in from thi time my constant practic wa as soon as i rose to perform that busi in open air at the full extent of my chain and due care wa taken everi morn befor compani came that the offens matter should be carri off in wheel barrow by two servant appoint for that purpos i would not have dwelt so long upon a circumst that perhap at first sight mai appear not veri moment if i had not thought it necessari to justifi my charact in point of cleanli to the world which i am told some of my malign have been pleas upon thi and other occas to call in question when thi adventur wa at an end i came back out of my hous have occas for fresh air the emperor wa alreadi descend from the tower and advanc on horseback toward me which had like to have cost him dear for the beast though veri well train yet wholli unus to such a sight which appear as if a mountain move befor him rear up on it hinder feet but that princ who is an excel horseman kept hi seat till hi attend ran in and held the bridl while hi majesti had time to dismount when he alight he survei me round with great admir but kept beyond the length of my chain he order hi cook and butler who were alreadi prepar to give me victual and drink which thei push forward in a sort of vehicl upon wheel till i could reach them i took these vehicl and soon empti them all twenti of them were fill with meat and ten with liquor each of the former afford me two or three good mouth and i empti the liquor of ten vessel which wa contain in earthen vial into on vehicl drink it off at a draught and so i did with the rest the empress and young princ of the blood of both sex attend by mani ladi sat at some distanc in their chair but upon the accid that happen to the emperor s hors thei

touch them till we found our finger stop by the lucid substanc he put thi engin into our ear which made an incess nois like that of a water mill and we conjectur it is either some unknown anim or the god that he worship but we ar more inclin to the latter opinion becaus he assur us if we understood him right for he express himself veri imperfectli that he seldom did ani thing without consult it he call it hi oracl and said it point out the time for everi action of hi life from the left fob he took out a net almost larg enough for a fisherman but contriv to open and shut like a purs and serv him

scabbard and cast it on the ground as gentli as i could about six feet from the end of my chain the next thing he demand wa on of the hollow iron pillar by which he meant my pocket pistol i drew it out and at hi desir as well as i could express to him the us of it and charg it onli with powder which by the close of my pouch happen to escap wet in the sea an inconveni against which all prudent marin take special care to provid i first caution the emperor not to be afraid and then i let it off in the air the astonish here wa much greater than at the sight of my scimitar hundr fell down as if thei had been struck dead and even the emperor although he stood hi ground could not recov himself for some time i deliv up both my pistol in the same manner as i had done my scimitar and then my

the great offic ar much upon a par these divers ar often attend with fatal accid whereof great number ar on record i myself have seen two or three candid break a limb but the danger is much greater when the minist themselv ar command to show their dexter for by contend to excel themselv and their fellow thei strain so far that there is hardli on of them who ha not receiv a fall and some of them

three dai after which i spent in cut down with my knife some of the largest tree in the royal park about a hundr yard distant from the citi of these tree i made two stool each about three feet high

my liberti said he might pretend to some merit in it but howev ad that if it had not been for the present situat of thing at court perhap i might not have obtain it so soon for said he as flourish a condit as we mai appear to be in to foreign we labour under two mighti evil a violent faction at home and the danger of an invas by a most potent enemi from abroad as to the first you ar to understand that for about seventi moon past there have been two struggl parti in thi empir under the name of tramecksan and slamecksan from the high and low heel of their shoe by which thei distinguish themselv it is alleg inde that the high heel ar most agreeabl to our ancient constitut but howev thi be hi majesti ha determin to make us onli of low heel in the administr of the govern and all offic in the gift of the crown as you cannot but observ and particularli that hi majesti s imperi heel ar lower at least by a drurr than ani of hi court drurr is a measur about the fourteenth part of an inch the animos between these two parti run so high that thei will neither eat nor drink nor talk with each other we comput the tramecksan or high heel to exce us in number but the power is wholli on our side we apprehend hi imperi high the heir to the crown to have some tendenc toward the high heel at least we can plainli discov that on of hi heel is higher than the other which give him a hobbl in hi gait now in the midst of these intestin disquiet we ar threaten with an invas from the island of blefuscu which is the other great empir of the univers almost as larg and power as thi of hi majesti for as to what we have heard you affirm that there ar other kingdom and state in the world inhabit by human creatur as larg as yourself our philosoph ar in much doubt and would rather conjectur that you drop from the moon or on of the star becaus it is certain that a hundr mortal of your bulk would in a short time destroi all the fruit and cattl of hi majesti s dominion besid our histori of six thousand moon make no mention of ani other region than the two great empir of lilliput and blefuscu which two mighti power have as i wa go to tell you been engag in a most obstin war for six and thirti moon past it began upon the follow occas it is allow on all hand that the primit wai of break egg befor we eat them wa upon the larger end but hi present majesti s grandfath while he wa a boi go to eat an egg and break it accord to the ancient practic happen to cut on of hi finger whereupon the emperor hi father publish an edict command all hi subject upon great penalti to break the smaller end of their egg the peopl so highli resent thi law that our histori tell us there have been six rebellion rais on that account wherein on emperor lost hi life and anoth hi crown these civil commot were constantli foment by the monarch of blefuscu and when thei were quell the exil alwai fled for refug to that empir it is comput that eleven thousand person have at sever time suffer death rather than submit to break their egg at the smaller end mani hundr larg volum have been publish upon thi controversi but the book of the big endian have been long forbidden and the whole parti render incap by law of hold employ dure the cours of these troubl the emperor of blefusca did frequent expostul by their ambassador accus us of make a schism in religion by offend against a fundament doctrin of our great prophet lustrog in the fifti fourth chapter of the blundecr which is their alcoran thi howev is thought to be a mere strain upon the text for the word ar these that all true believ break their egg at the conveni end and which is the conveni end seem in my humbl opinion to be left to everi man s conscienc or at least in the power of the chief magistr to determin now the big endian exil have found so much credit in the emperor of blefuscu s court and so much privat assist and encourag from their parti here at home that a bloodi war ha been carri on between the two empir for six and thirti moon with variou success dure which time we have lost forti capit ship and a much a greater number of smaller vessel togeth with thirti thousand of our best seamen and soldier and the damag receiv by the enemi is reckon to be somewhat greater than our howev thei have now equip a numer fleet and ar just prepar to make a descent upon us and hi imperi majesti place great confid in your valour and strength ha command me to lai thi account of hi affair befor you i desir the secretari to present my humbl duti to the emperor and to let him know that i thought it would not becom me who wa a foreign to interfer with parti but i wa readi with the hazard of my life to defend hi person and state against all invad chapter v the author by an extraordinari stratagem prevent an invas a high titl of honour is confer upon him ambassador arriv from the emperor of blefuscu and sue for peac the empress s apart on fire by an accid the author instrument in save the rest of the palac the empir of blefuscu is an island situat to the north east of lilliput from which it is part onli by a channel of eight hundr yard wide i had not yet seen it and upon thi notic of an intend invas i avoid appear on that side of the coast for fear of be discov by some of the enemi s ship who had receiv no intellig of me all intercours between the two empir have been strictli forbidden dure the war upon pain of death and an embargo laid by our emperor upon all vessel whatsoev i commun to hi majesti a project i had form of seiz the enemi s whole fleet which as our scout assur us lai at anchor in the harbour readi to sail with the first fair wind i consult the most experienc seamen upon the depth of the channel which thei had often plumb who told me that in the middl at high water it wa seventi glumgluff deep which is about six feet of european measur and the rest of it fifti glumgluff at most i walk toward the north east coast over against blefuscu where ly down behind a hillock i took out my small perspect glass and view the enemi s fleet at anchor consist of about fifti men of war and a great number of transport i then came back to my hous and gave order for which i had a warrant for a great quantiti of the strongest cabl and bar of iron the cabl wa about as thick as packthread and the bar of the length and size of a knit needl i trebl the cabl to make it stronger and for the same reason i twist three of the iron bar togeth bend the extrem into a hook have thu fix fifti hook to as mani cabl i went back to the north east coast and put off my coat shoe and stock walk into the sea in my leathern jerkin about half an hour befor high water i wade with what hast i could and swam in the middl about thirti yard till i felt ground i arriv at the fleet in less than half an hour the enemi wa so frighten when thei saw me that thei leap out of their ship and swam to shore where there could not be fewer than thirti thousand soul i then took my tackl and fasten a hook to the hole at the prow of each i ti all the cord togeth at the end while i wa thu emploi the enemi discharg sever thousand arrow mani of which stuck in my hand and face and besid the excess smart gave me much disturb in my work my greatest apprehens wa for mine ey which i should have infal lost if i had not suddenli thought of an expedi i kept among other littl necessari a pair of spectacl in a privat pocket which as i observ befor had escap the emperor s searcher these i took out and fasten as strongli as i could upon my nose and thu arm went on boldli with my work in spite of the enemi s arrow mani of which struck against the glass of my spectacl but without ani other effect further than a littl to discompos them i had now fasten all the hook and take the knot in my hand began to pull but not a ship would stir for thei were all too fast held by their anchor so that the boldest part of my enterpris remain i therefor let go the cord and leav the look fix to the ship i resolut cut with my knife the cabl that fasten the anchor receiv about two hundr shot in my face and hand then i took up the knot end of the cabl to which my hook were ti and with great eas drew fifti of the enemi s largest men of war after me the blefuscudian who had not the least imagin of what i intend were at first confound with astonish thei had seen me cut the cabl and thought my design wa onli to let the ship run adrift or fall foul on each other but when thei perceiv the whole fleet move in order and saw me pull at the end thei set up such a scream of grief and despair as it is almost imposs to describ or conceiv when i had got out of danger i stop awhil to pick out the arrow that stuck in my hand and face and rub on some of the same ointment that wa given me at my first arriv as i have formerli mention i then took off my spectacl and wait about an hour till the tide wa a littl fallen i wade through the middl with my cargo and arriv safe at the royal port of lilliput the emperor and hi whole court stood on the shore expect the issu of thi great adventur thei saw the ship move forward in a larg half moon but could not discern me who wa up to my breast in water when i advanc to the middl of the channel thei were yet more in pain becaus i wa under water to my neck the emperor conclud me to be drown and that the enemi s fleet wa approach in a hostil manner but he wa soon eas of hi fear for the channel grow shallow everi step i made i came in a short time within hear and hold up the end of the cabl by which the fleet wa fasten i cri in a loud voic long live the most puissant king of lilliput thi great princ receiv me at my land with all possibl encomium and creat me a nardac upon the spot which is the highest titl of honour among them hi majesti desir i would take some other opportun of bring all the rest of hi enemi s ship into hi port and so unmeasur is the ambit of princ that he seem to think of noth less than reduc the whole empir of blefuscu into a provinc and govern it by a viceroi of destroi the big endian exil and compel that peopl to break the smaller end of their egg by which he would remain the sole monarch of the whole world but i endeavour to divert him from thi design by mani argument drawn from the topic of polici as well as justic and i plainli protest that i would never be an instrument of bring a free and brave peopl into slaveri and when the matter wa debat in council the wisest part of the ministri were of my opinion thi open bold declar of mine wa so opposit to the scheme and polit of hi imperi majesti that he could never forgiv me he mention it in a veri art manner at council where i wa told that some of the wisest appear at least by their silenc to be of my opinion but other who were my secret enemi could not forbear some express which by a side wind reflect on me and from thi time began an intrigu between hi majesti and a junto of minist malici bent against me which broke out in less than two month and had like to have end in my utter destruct of so littl weight ar the greatest servic to princ when put into the balanc with a refus to gratifi their passion about three week after thi exploit there arriv a solemn embassi from blefuscu with humbl offer of a peac which wa soon conclud upon condit veri advantag to our emperor wherewith i shall not troubl the reader there were six ambassador with a train of about five hundr person and their entri wa veri magnific suitabl to the grandeur of their master and the import of their busi when their treati wa finish wherein i did them sever good offic by the credit i now had or at least appear to have at court their excel who were privat told how much i had been their friend made me a visit in form thei began with mani compliment upon my valour and generos invit me to that kingdom in the emperor their master s name and desir me to show them some proof of my prodigi strength of which thei had heard so mani wonder wherein i readili oblig them but shall not troubl the reader with the particular when i had for some time entertain their excel to their infinit satisfact and surpris i desir thei would do me the honour to present my most humbl respect to the emperor their master the renown of whose virtu had so justli fill the whole world with admir and whose royal person i resolv to attend befor i return to my own countri accordingli the next time i had the honour to see our emperor i desir hi gener licens to wait on the blefuscudian monarch which he wa pleas to grant me as i could perceiv in a veri cold manner but could not guess the reason till i had a whisper from a certain person that flimnap and bolgolam had repres my intercours with those ambassador as a mark of disaffect from which i am sure my heart wa wholli free and thi wa the first time i began to conceiv some imperfect idea of court and minist it is to be observ that these ambassador spoke to me by an interpret the languag of both empir differ as much from each other as ani two in europ and each nation pride itself upon the antiqu beauti and energi of their own tongu with an avow contempt for that of their neighbour yet our emperor stand upon the advantag he had got by the seizur of their fleet oblig them to deliv their credenti and make their speech in the lilliputian tongu and it must be confess that from the great intercours of trade and commerc between both realm from the continu recept of exil which is mutual among them and from the custom in each empir to send their young nobil and richer gentri to the other in order to polish themselv by see the world and understand men and manner there ar few person of distinct or merchant or seamen who dwell in the maritim part but what can hold convers in both tongu as i found some week after when i went to pai my respect to the emperor of blefuscu which in the midst of great misfortun through the malic of my enemi prove a veri happi adventur to me as i shall relat in it proper place the reader mai rememb that when i sign those articl upon which i recov my liberti there were some which i dislik upon account of their be too servil neither could anyth but an extrem necess have forc me to submit but be now a nardac of the highest rank in that empir such offic were look upon as below my digniti and the emperor to do him justic never onc mention them to me howev it wa not long befor i had an opportun of do hi majesti at least as i then thought a most signal servic i wa alarm at midnight with the cri of mani hundr peopl at my door by which be suddenli awak i wa in some kind of terror i heard the word burglum repeat incessantli sever of the emperor s court make their wai through the crowd entreat me to come immedi to the palac where her imperi majesti s apart wa on fire by the careless of a maid of honour who fell asleep while she wa read a romanc i got up in an instant and order be given to clear the wai befor me and it be likewis a moonshin night i made a shift to get to the palac without trampl on ani of the peopl i found thei had alreadi appli ladder to the wall of the apart and were well provid with bucket but the water wa at some distanc these bucket were about the size of larg thimbl and the poor peopl suppli me with them as fast as thei could but the flame wa so violent that thei did littl good i might easili have stifl it with my coat which i unfortun left behind me for hast and came awai onli in my leathern jerkin the case seem wholli desper and deplor and thi magnific palac would have infal been burnt down to the ground if by a presenc of mind unusu to me i had not suddenli thought of an expedi i had the even befor drunk plentifulli of a most delici wine call glimigrim the blefuscudian call it flunec but our is esteem the better sort which is veri diuret by the luckiest chanc in the world i had not discharg myself of ani part of it the heat i had contract by come veri near the flame and by labour to quench them made the wine begin to oper by urin which i void in such a quantiti and appli so well to the proper place that in three minut the fire wa wholli extinguish and the rest of that nobl pile which had cost so mani ag in erect preserv from destruct it wa now dai light and i return to my hous without wait to congratul with the emperor becaus although i had done a veri emin piec of servic yet i could not tell how hi majesti might resent the manner by which i had perform it for by the fundament law of the realm it is capit in ani person of what qualiti soever to make water within the precinct of the palac but i wa a littl comfort by a messag from hi majesti that he would give order to the grand justiciari for pass my pardon in form which howev i could not obtain and i wa privat assur that the empress conceiv the greatest abhorr of what i had done remov to the most distant side of the court firmli resolv that those build should never be repair for her us and in the presenc of her chief confid could not forbear vow reveng chapter vi of the inhabit of lilliput their learn law and custom the manner of educ their children the author s wai of live in that countri hi vindic of a great ladi although i intend to leav the descript of thi empir to a particular treatis yet in the mean time i am content to gratifi the curiou reader with some gener idea as the common size of the nativ is somewhat under six inch high so there is an exact proport in all other anim as well as plant and tree for instanc the tallest hors and oxen ar between four and five inch in height the sheep an inch and half more or less their gees about the big of a sparrow and so the sever gradat downward till you come to the smallest which to my sight were almost invis but natur ha adapt the ey of the lilliputian to all object proper for their view thei see with great exact but at no great distanc and to show the sharp of their sight toward object that ar near i have been much pleas with observ a cook pull a lark which wa not so larg as a common fly and a young girl thread an invis needl with invis silk their tallest tree ar about seven feet high i mean some of those in the great royal park the top whereof i could but just reach with my fist clench the other veget ar in the same proport but thi i leav to the reader s imagin i shall sai but littl at present of their learn which for mani ag ha flourish in all it branch among them but their manner of write is veri peculiar be neither from the left to the right like the european nor from the right to the left like the arabian nor from up to down like the chines but aslant from on corner of the paper to the other like ladi in england thei buri their dead with their head directli downward becaus thei hold an opinion that in eleven thousand moon thei ar all to rise again in which period the earth which thei conceiv to be flat will turn upsid down and by thi mean thei shall at their resurrect be found readi stand on their feet the learn among them confess the absurd of thi doctrin but the practic still continu in complianc to the vulgar there ar some law and custom in thi empir veri peculiar and if thei were not so directli contrari to those of my own dear countri i should be tempt to sai a littl in their justif it is onli to be wish thei were as well execut the first i shall mention relat to inform all crime against the state ar punish here with the utmost sever but if the person accus make hi innoc plainli to appear upon hi trial the accus is immedi put to an ignomini death and out of hi good or land the innoc person is quadrupli recompens for the loss of hi time for the danger he underw for the hardship of hi imprison and for all the charg he ha been at in make hi defenc or if that fund be defici it is larg suppli by the crown the emperor also confer on him some public mark of hi favour and proclam is made of hi innoc through the whole citi thei look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft and therefor seldom fail to punish it with death for thei alleg that care and vigil with a veri common understand mai preserv a man s good from thiev but honesti ha no defenc against superior cun and sinc it is necessari that there should be a perpetu intercours of bui and sell and deal upon credit where fraud is permit and conniv at or ha no law to punish it the honest dealer is alwai undon and the knave get the advantag i rememb when i wa onc interced with the emperor for a crimin who had wrong hi master of a great sum of monei which he had receiv by order and ran awai with and happen to tell hi majesti by wai of extenu that it wa onli a breach of trust the emperor thought it monstrou in me to offer as a defenc the greatest aggrav of the crime and truli i had littl to sai in return farther than the common answer that differ nation had differ custom for i confess i wa heartili asham although we usual call reward and punish the two hing upon which all govern turn yet i could never observ thi maxim to be put in practic by ani nation except that of lilliput whoever can there bring suffici proof that he ha strictli observ the law of hi countri for seventi three moon ha a claim to certain privileg accord to hi qualiti or condit of life with a proportion sum of monei out of a fund appropri for that us he likewis acquir the titl of snilpal or legal which is ad to hi name but doe not descend to hi poster and these peopl thought it a prodigi defect of polici among us when i told them that our law were enforc onli by penalti without ani mention of reward it is upon thi account that the imag of justic in their court of judicatur is form with six ey two befor as mani behind and on each side on to signifi circumspect with a bag of gold open in her right hand and a sword sheath in her left to show she is more dispos to reward than to punish in choos person for all employ thei have more regard to good moral than to great abil for sinc govern is necessari to mankind thei believ that the common size of human understand is fit to some station or other and that provid never intend to make the manag of public affair a mysteri to be comprehend onli by a few person of sublim geniu of which there seldom ar three born in an ag but thei suppos truth justic temper and the like to be in everi man s power the practic of which virtu assist by experi and a good intent would qualifi ani man for the servic of hi countri except where a cours of studi is requir but thei thought the want of moral virtu wa so far from be suppli by superior endow of the mind that employ could never be put into such danger hand as those of person so qualifi and at least that the mistak commit by ignor in a virtuou disposit would never be of such fatal consequ to the public weal as the practic of a man whose inclin led him to be corrupt and who had great abil to manag to multipli and defend hi corrupt in like manner the disbelief of a divin provid render a man incap of hold ani public station for sinc king avow themselv to be the deputi of provid the lilliputian think noth can be more absurd than for a princ to emploi such men as disown the author under which he act in relat these and the follow law i would onli be understood to mean the origin institut and not the most scandal corrupt into which these peopl ar fallen by the degener natur of man for as to that infam practic of acquir great employ by danc on the rope or badg of favour and distinct by leap over stick and creep under them the reader is to observ that thei were first introduc by the grandfath of the emperor now reign and grew to the present height by the gradual increas of parti and faction ingratitud is among them a capit crime as we read it to have been in some other countri for thei reason thu that whoever make ill return to hi benefactor must need be a common enemi to the rest of mankind from whom he ha receiv no oblig and therefor such a man is not fit to live their notion relat to the duti of parent and children differ extrem from our for sinc the conjunct of male and femal is found upon the great law of natur in order to propag and continu the speci the lilliputian will need have it that men and women ar join togeth like other anim by the motiv of concupisc and that their tender toward their young proce from the like natur principl for which reason thei will never allow that a child is under ani oblig to hi father for beget him or to hi mother for bring him into the world which consid the miseri of human life wa neither a benefit in itself nor intend so by hi parent whose thought in their love encount were otherwis emploi upon these and the like reason their opinion is that parent ar the last of all other to be trust with the educ of their own children and therefor thei have in everi town public nurseri where all parent except cottag and labour ar oblig to send their infant of both sex to be rear and educ when thei come to the ag of twenti moon at which time thei ar suppos to have some rudiment of docil these school ar of sever kind suit to differ qualiti and both sex thei have certain professor well skill in prepar children for such a condit of life as befit the rank of their parent and their own capac as well as inclin i shall first sai someth of the male nurseri and then of the femal the nurseri for male of nobl or emin birth ar provid with grave and learn professor and their sever deputi the cloth and

twice a year the visit is to last but an hour thei ar allow to kiss the child at meet and part but a professor who alwai stand by on those occas will not suffer them to whisper or us ani fondl express or bring ani present of toi sweetmeat and the like the pension from each famili for the educ and entertain of a child upon failur of due payment is levi by the emperor s offic the nurseri for children of ordinari gentlemen merchant trader and handicraft ar manag proportion after the same manner onli those design for trade ar put out apprentic at eleven year old wherea those of person of qualiti

who have children at these nurseri ar oblig besid their annual pension which is as low as possibl to return to the steward of the nurseri a small monthli share of their get to be a portion for the child and therefor all parent ar limit in their expens by the law for the lilliputian think noth can be more unjust than for peopl in subservi to their own appetit to bring children into the world and leav the burthen of support them on the public as to person of qualiti thei give secur to appropri a certain sum for each child suitabl to their condit and these fund ar alwai manag with good

countri dure a resid of nine month and thirteen dai have a head mechan turn and be likewis forc by necess i had made for myself a tabl and chair conveni enough out of the largest tree in the royal

usual in honour to my dear countri as well as to fill the court with admir i have some privat reason to believ that thi visit from hi majesti gave flimnap an opportun of do me ill offic to hi master that minist had alwai been my secret enemi though he outwardli caress me more than wa usual to the moros of hi natur he repres to the emperor the low condit of hi treasuri that he wa forc to take up

and abet the emperor of blefuscu so late an enemi and in open war with hi imperi majesti aforesaid there ar some other articl but these ar the most import of which i have read you an abstract in the sever debat upon thi impeach it must be confess that hi majesti gave mani mark of hi great leniti often urg the servic you had done him and endeavour to extenu your crime the treasur and admir insist that you should be put to the most pain and ignomini death by set fire to your hous at night and the gener wa to attend with twenti thousand men arm with poison arrow to shoot you on the face and hand some of your servant were to have privat order to strew a poison juic on your shirt and sheet which would soon make you tear your own flesh and die in the utmost tortur the gener came into the same opinion so that for a long time there wa a major against you but hi majesti resolv if possibl to spare your life at last brought off the chamberlain upon thi incid reldres princip secretari for privat affair who alwai approv himself your true friend wa command by the emperor to deliv hi opinion which he accordingli did and therein justifi the good thought you have of him he allow your crime to be great but that still there wa room for merci the most commend virtu in a princ and for which hi majesti wa so justli celebr he said the friendship between you and him wa so well known to the world that perhap the most honour board might think him partial howev in obedi to the command he had receiv he would freeli offer hi sentiment that if hi majesti in consider of your servic and pursuant to hi own merci disposit would pleas to spare your life and onli give order to put out both your ey he humbl conceiv that by thi expedi justic might in some measur be satisfi and all the world would applaud the leniti of the emperor as well as the fair and gener proceed of those who have the honour to be hi counsellor that the loss of your ey would be no impedi to your bodili strength by which you might still be us to hi majesti that blind is an addit to courag by conceal danger from us that the fear you had for your ey wa the greatest difficulti in bring over the enemi s fleet and it would be suffici for you to see by the ey of the minist sinc the greatest princ do no more thi propos wa receiv with the utmost disapprob by the whole board bolgolam the admir could not preserv hi temper but rise up in furi said he wonder how the secretari durst presum to give hi opinion for preserv the life of a traitor that the servic you had perform were by all true reason of state the great aggrav of your crime that you who were abl to extinguish the fire by discharg of urin in her majesti s apart which he mention with horror might at anoth time rais an inund by the same mean to drown the whole palac and the same strength which enabl you to bring over the enemi s fleet might serv upon the first discont to carri it back that he had good reason to think you were a big endian in your heart and as treason begin in the heart befor it appear in overt act so he accus you as a traitor on that account and therefor insist you should be put to death the treasur wa of the same opinion he show to what strait hi majesti s revenu wa reduc by the charg of maintain you which would soon grow insupport that the secretari s expedi of put out your ey wa so far from be a remedi against thi evil that it would probabl increas it as is manifest from the common practic of blind some kind of fowl after which thei fed the faster and grew sooner fat that hi sacr majesti and the council who ar your judg were in their own conscienc fulli convinc of your guilt which wa a suffici argument to condemn you to death without the formal proof requir by the strict letter of the law but hi imperi majesti fulli determin against capit punish wa gracious pleas to sai that sinc the council thought the loss of your ey too easi a censur some other wai mai be inflict hereaft and your friend the secretari humbl desir to be heard again in answer to what the treasur had object concern the great charg hi majesti wa at in maintain you said that hi excel who had the sole dispos of the emperor s revenu might easili provid against that evil by gradual lessen your establish by which for want of suffici for you would grow weak and faint and lose your appetit and consequ decai and consum in a few month neither would the stench of your carcass be then so danger when it should becom more than half diminish and immedi upon your death five or six thousand of hi majesti s subject might in two or three dai cut your flesh from your bone take it awai by cart load and buri it in distant part to prevent infect leav the skeleton as a monument of admir to poster thu by the great friendship of the secretari the whole affair wa compromis it wa strictli enjoin that the project of starv you by degre should be kept a secret but the sentenc of put out your ey wa enter on the book none dissent except bolgolam the admir who be a creatur of the empress wa perpetu instig by her majesti to insist upon your death she have born perpetu malic against you on account of that infam and illeg method you took to extinguish the fire in her apart in three dai your friend the secretari will be direct to come to your hous and read befor you the articl of impeach and then to signifi the great leniti and favour of hi majesti and council wherebi you ar onli condemn to the loss of your ey which hi majesti doe not question you will gratefulli and humbl submit to and twenti of hi majesti s surgeon will attend in order to see the oper well perform by discharg veri sharp point arrow into the ball of your ey as you lie on the ground i leav to your prudenc what measur you will take and to avoid suspicion i must immedi return in as privat a manner as i came hi lordship did so and i remain alon under mani doubt and perplex of mind it wa a custom introduc by thi princ and hi ministri veri differ as i have been assur from the practic of former time that after the court had decre ani cruel execut either to gratifi the monarch s resent or the malic of a favourit the emperor alwai made a speech to hi whole council express hi great leniti and tender as qualiti known and confess by all the world thi speech wa immedi publish throughout the kingdom nor did ani thing terrifi the peopl so much as those encomium on hi majesti s merci becaus it wa observ that the more these prais were enlarg and insist on the more inhuman wa the punish and the suffer more innoc yet as to myself i must confess have never been design for a courtier either by my birth or educ i wa so ill a judg of thing that i could not discov the leniti and favour of thi sentenc but conceiv it perhap erron rather to be rigor than gentl i sometim thought of stand my trial for although i could not deni the fact alleg in the sever articl yet i hope thei would admit of some extenu but have in my life perus mani state trial which i ever observ to termin as the judg thought fit to direct i durst not reli on so danger a decis in so critic a junctur and against such power enemi onc i wa strongli bent upon resist for while i had liberti the whole strength of that empir could hardli subdu me and i might easili with stone pelt the metropoli to piec but i soon reject that project with horror by rememb the oath i had made to the emperor the favour i receiv from him and the high titl of nardac he confer upon me neither had i so soon learn the gratitud of courtier to persuad myself that hi majesti s present seventi acquit me of all past oblig at last i fix upon a resolut for which it is probabl i mai incur some censur and not unjustli for i confess i ow the preserv of mine ey and consequ my liberti to my own great rash and want of experi becaus if i had then known the natur of princ and minist which i have sinc observ in mani other court and their method of treat crimin less obnoxi than myself i should with great alacr and readi have submit to so easi a punish but hurri on by the precipit of youth and have hi imperi majesti s licens to pai my attend upon the emperor of blefuscu i took thi opportun befor the three dai were elaps to send a letter to my friend the secretari signifi my resolut of set out that morn for blefuscu pursuant to the leav i had got and without wait for an answer i went to that side of the island where our fleet lai i seiz a larg man of war ti a cabl to the prow and lift up the anchor i strip myself put my cloth togeth with my coverlet which i carri under my arm into the vessel and draw it after me between wade and swim arriv at the royal port of blefuscu where the peopl had long expect me thei lent me two guid to direct me to the capit citi which is of the same name i held them in my hand till i came within two hundr yard of the gate and desir them to signifi my arriv to on of the secretari and let him know i there wait hi majesti s command i had an answer in about an hour that hi majesti attend by the royal famili and great offic of the court wa come out to receiv me i advanc a hundr yard the emperor and hi train alight from their hors the empress and ladi from their coach and i did not perceiv thei were in ani fright or concern i lai on the ground to kiss hi majesti s and the empress s hand i told hi majesti that i wa come accord to my promis and with the licens of the emperor my master to have the honour of see so mighti a monarch and to offer him ani servic in my power consist with my duti to my own princ not mention a word of my disgrac becaus i had hitherto no regular inform of it and might suppos myself wholli ignor of ani such design neither could i reason conceiv that the emperor would discov the secret while i wa out of hi power wherein howev it soon appear i wa deceiv i shall not troubl the reader with the particular account of my recept at thi court which wa suitabl to the generos of so great a princ nor of the difficulti i wa in for want of a hous and bed be forc to lie on the ground wrap up in my coverlet chapter viii the author by a lucki accid find mean to leav blefuscu and after some difficulti return safe to hi nativ countri three dai after my arriv walk out of curios to the north east coast of the island i observ about half a leagu off in the sea somewhat that look like a boat overturn i pull off my shoe and stock and wail two or three hundr yard i found the object to approach nearer by forc of the tide and then plainli saw it to be a real boat which i suppos might by some tempest have been driven from a ship whereupon i return immedi toward the citi and desir hi imperi majesti to lend me twenti of the tallest vessel he had left after the loss of hi fleet and three thousand seamen under the command of hi vice admir thi fleet sail round while i went back the shortest wai to the coast where i first discov the boat i found the tide had driven it still nearer the seamen were all provid with cordag which i had beforehand twist to a suffici strength when the ship came up i strip myself and wade till i came within a hundr yard off the boat after which i wa forc to swim till i got up to it the seamen threw me the end of the cord which i fasten to a hole in the fore part of the boat and the other end to a man of war but i found all my labour to littl purpos for be out of my depth i wa not abl to work in thi necess i wa forc to swim behind and push the boat forward as often as i could with on of my hand and the tide favour me i advanc so far that i could just hold up my chin and feel the ground i rest two or three minut and then gave the boat anoth shove and so on till the sea wa no higher than my arm pit and now the most labori part be over i took out my other cabl which were stow in on of the ship and fasten them first to the boat and then to nine of the vessel which attend me the wind be favour the seamen tow and i shove until we arriv within forti yard of the shore and wait till the tide wa out i got dry to the boat and by the assist of two thousand men with rope and engin i made a shift to turn it on it bottom and found it wa but littl damag i shall not troubl the reader with the difficulti i wa under by the help of certain paddl which cost me ten dai make to get my boat to the royal port of blefuscu where a mighti concours of peopl appear upon my arriv full of wonder at the sight of so prodigi a vessel i told the emperor that my good fortun had thrown thi boat in my wai to carri me to some place whenc i might return into my nativ countri and beg hi majesti s order for get materi to fit it up togeth with hi licens to depart which after some kind expostul he wa pleas to grant i did veri much wonder in all thi time not to have heard of ani express relat to me from our emperor to the court of blefuscu but i wa afterward given privat to understand that hi imperi majesti never imagin i had the least notic of hi design believ i wa onli gone to blefuscu in perform of my promis accord to the licens he had given me which wa well known at our court and would return in a few dai when the ceremoni wa end but he wa at last in pain at my long absenc and after consult with the treasur and the rest of that cabal a person of qualiti wa dispatch with the copi of the articl against me thi envoi had instruct to repres to the monarch of blefuscu the great leniti of hi master who wa content to punish me no farther than with the loss of mine ey that i had fled from justic and if i did not return in two hour i should be depriv of my titl of nardac and declar a traitor the envoi further ad that in order to maintain the peac and amiti between both empir hi master expect that hi brother of blefuscu would give order to have me sent back to lilliput bound hand and foot to

although i had depriv him of hi fleet yet he ow great oblig to me for mani good offic i had done him in make the peac that howev both their majesti would soon be made easi for i had found a prodigi vessel on the shore abl to carri me on the sea which he had given order to fit up with my own assist and direct and he hope in a few week both empir would be freed from so insupport an encumbr with thi answer the envoi return to lilliput and the monarch of blefuscu relat to me all that had pass offer me at the same time but under the strictest confid hi graciou protect if i would continu in hi servic wherein although i believ him sincer yet i resolv never more to put ani confid in princ or minist where i could possibl avoid it and therefor with all due acknowledg for hi favour intent i humbl beg to be excus i told him that sinc fortun whether good or evil had thrown a vessel in my wai i wa resolv to ventur myself on the ocean rather than be an occas of differ between two such mighti monarch neither did i find the emperor at all displeas and i discov by a certain accid that he wa veri glad of my resolut and so were most of hi minist these consider move me to hasten my departur

the captain fall sick of an agu we could not leav the cape till the end of march we then set sail and had a good voyag till we pass the strait of madagascar but have got northward of that island and to about five degre south latitud the wind which in those sea ar observ to blow a constant equal gale between the north and west from the begin of decemb to the begin of mai on the th of april began to blow with much greater violenc and more westerli than usual continu so for twenti dai togeth dure which time we were driven a littl to the east of the molucca island and about three degre northward of the line as our captain found by an observ he took the nd of mai at which time the wind ceas and it wa a perfect calm whereat i wa not a littl rejoic but he be a man well experienc in the navig of those sea bid us all prepar against a storm which accordingli happen the dai follow for the southern wind call the southern monsoon began to set in find it wa like to overblow we took in our sprit sail and stood by to hand the fore sail but make foul weather we look the gun were all fast and hand the mizen the ship lai veri broad off so we thought it better spoon befor the sea than try or hull we reef the fore sail and set him and haul aft the fore sheet the helm wa hard a weather the ship wore brave we belai the fore down haul but the sail wa split and we haul down the yard and got the sail into the ship and unbound all the thing clear of it it wa a veri fierc storm the sea broke strang and danger we haul off upon the laniard of the whip staff and help the man at the helm we would not get down our topmast but let all stand becaus she scud befor the sea veri well and we knew that the top mast be aloft the ship wa the wholesom and made better wai through the sea see we had sea room when the storm wa over we set fore sail and main sail and brought the ship to then we set the mizen main top sail and the fore top sail our cours wa east north east the wind wa at south west we got the starboard tack aboard we cast off our weather brace and lift we set in the lee brace and haul forward by the weather bowl and haul them tight and belai them and haul over the mizen tack to windward and kept her full and by as near as she would lie dure thi storm which wa follow by a strong wind west south west we were carri by my comput about five hundr leagu to the east so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell in what part of the world we were our provis held out well our ship wa staunch and our crew all in good health but we lai in the utmost distress for water we thought it best to hold on the same cours rather than turn more northerli which might have brought us to the north west part of great tartari and into the frozen sea on the th dai of june a boi on the top mast discov land on the th we came in full view of a great island or contin for we knew not whether on the south side whereof wa a small neck of land jut out into the sea and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of abov on hundr ton we cast anchor within a leagu of thi creek and our captain sent a dozen of hi men well arm in the long boat with vessel for water if ani could be found i desir hi leav to go with them that i might see the countri and make what discoveri i could when we came to land we saw no river or spring nor ani sign of inhabit our men therefor wander on the shore to find out some fresh water near the sea and i walk alon about a mile on the other side where i observ the countri all barren and rocki i now began to be weari and see noth to entertain my curios i return gentli down toward the creek and the sea be full in my view i saw our men alreadi got into the boat and row for life to the ship i wa go to holla after them although it had been to littl purpos when i observ a huge creatur walk after them in the sea as fast as he could he wade not much deeper than hi knee and took prodigi stride but our men had the start of him half a leagu and the sea thereabout be full of sharp point rock the monster wa not abl to overtak the boat thi i wa afterward told for i durst not stai to see the issu of the adventur but ran as fast as i could the wai i first went and then climb up a steep hill which gave me some prospect of the countri i found it fulli cultiv but that which first surpris me wa the length of the grass which in those ground that seem to be kept for hai wa about twenti feet high i fell into a high road for so i took it to be though it serv to the inhabit onli as a foot path through a field of barlei here i walk on for some time but could see littl on either side it be now near harvest and the corn rise at least forti feet i wa an hour walk to the end of thi field which wa fenc in with a hedg of at least on hundr and twenti feet high and the tree so lofti that i could make no comput of their altitud there wa a stile to pass from thi field into the next it had four step and a stone to cross over when you came to the uppermost it wa imposs for me to climb thi stile becaus everi step wa six feet high and the upper stone about twenti i wa endeavour to find some gap in the hedg when i discov on of the inhabit in the next field advanc toward the stile of the same size with him whom i saw in the sea pursu our boat he appear as tall as an ordinari spire steepl and took about ten yard at everi stride as near as i could guess i wa struck with the utmost fear and astonish and ran to hide myself in the corn whenc i saw him at the top of the stile look back into the next field on the right hand and heard him call in a voic mani degre louder than a speak trumpet but the nois wa so high in the air that at first i certainli thought it wa thunder whereupon seven monster like himself came toward him with reap hook in their hand each hook about the larg of six scyth these peopl were not so well clad as the first whose servant or labour thei seem to be for upon some word he spoke thei went to reap the corn in the field where i lai i kept from them at as great a distanc as i could but wa forc to move with extrem difficulti for the stalk of the corn were sometim not abov a foot distant so that i could hardli squeez my bodi betwixt them howev i made a shift to go forward till i came to a part of the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind here it wa imposs for me to advanc a step for the stalk were so interwoven that i could not creep through and the beard of the fallen ear so strong and point that thei pierc through my cloth into my flesh at the same time i heard the reaper not a hundr yard behind me be quit dispirit with toil and wholli overcom by grief and dispair i lai down between two ridg and heartili wish i might there end my dai i bemoan my desol widow and fatherless children i lament my own folli and wil in attempt a second voyag against the advic of all my friend and relat in thi terribl agit of mind i could not forbear think of lilliput whose inhabit look upon me as the greatest prodigi that ever appear in the world where i wa abl to draw an imperi fleet in my hand and perform those other action which will be record for ever in the chronicl of that empir while poster shall hardli believ them although attest by million i reflect what a mortif it must prove to me to appear as inconsider in thi nation as on singl lilliputian would be among us but thi i conceiv wa to be the least of my misfortun for as human creatur ar observ to be more savag and cruel in proport to their bulk what could i expect but to be a morsel in the mouth of the first among these enorm barbarian that should happen to seiz me undoubtedli philosoph ar in the right when thei tell us that noth is great or littl otherwis than by comparison it might have pleas fortun to have let the lilliputian find some nation where the peopl were as diminut with respect to them as thei were to me and who know but that even thi prodigi race of mortal might be equal overmatch in some distant part of the world whereof we have yet no discoveri scare and confound as i wa i could not forbear go on with these reflect when on of the reaper approach within ten yard of the ridg where i lai made me apprehend that with the next step i should be squash to death under hi foot or cut in two with hi reap hook and therefor when he wa again about to move i scream as loud as fear could make me whereupon the huge creatur trod short and look round about under him for some time at last espi me as i lai on the ground he consid awhil with the caution of on who endeavour to lai hold on a small danger anim in such a

at work and turn my head i found it proceed from the pur of that anim who seem to be three time larger than an ox as i comput by the view of her head and on of her paw while her mistress wa feed and stroke her the fierc of thi creatur s counten altogeth discompos me though i stood at the farther end of the tabl abov fifti feet off and although my mistress held her fast for fear she might give a

true by experi in my travel that fly or discov fear befor a fierc anim is a certain wai to make it pursu or attack you so i resolv in thi danger junctur to show no manner of concern i walk with intrepid five or six time befor the veri head of the cat and came within half a yard of her whereupon she drew herself back as if she were more afraid of me i had less apprehens concern the dog whereof three or four came into the room as it is usual in farmer hous on of which wa a mastiff equal in bulk to four eleph and anoth a greyhound somewhat taller than the mastiff but not so larg when dinner wa almost done the nurs came in with a child of a year old in her arm who immedi spi me and began a squall that you might have heard from london bridg to chelsea after the usual oratori of

command my master to carri me immedi thither for the divers of the queen and her ladi some of the latter had alreadi been to see me and report strang thing of my beauti behaviour and good sens her majesti and those who attend her were beyond measur delight with my demeanour i fell on my knee and beg the honour of kiss her imperi foot but thi graciou princess held out her littl finger toward me after i wa set on the tabl which i embrac in both my arm and put the tip of it with the utmost respect to my lip she made me some gener question about my countri and my travel which i answer as distinctli and in as few word as i could she ask whether i could be content to live at court i bow down to the board of the tabl and humbl answer that i wa my master s slave but if i were at my own

chamber of sixteen feet squar and twelv high with sash window a door and two closet like a london bed chamber the board that made the ceil wa to be lift up and down by two hing to put in a bed readi furnish by her majesti s upholster which glumdalclitch took out everi dai to air made it with her own hand and let it down at night lock up the roof over me a nice workman who wa famou for littl curios undertook to make me two chair with back and frame of a substanc not unlik ivori and two tabl with a cabinet to put my thing in the room wa quilt on all side as well as the floor and the ceil to prevent ani accid from the careless of those who carri me and to break the forc of a jolt when i went in a coach i desir a lock for my door to prevent rat and mice from come in the smith after sever attempt made the smallest that ever wa seen among them for i have known a larger at the gate of a gentleman s hous in england i made a shift to keep the kei in a pocket of my own fear glumdalclitch might lose it the queen likewis order the thinnest silk that could be gotten to make me cloth not much thicker than an english blanket veri cumbersom till i wa accustom to them thei were after the fashion of the kingdom partli resembl the persian and partli the chines and ar a veri grave and decent habit the queen becam so fond of my compani that she could not dine without me i had a tabl place upon the same at which her majesti at just at her left elbow and a chair to sit on glumdalclitch stood on a stool on the floor near my tabl to assist and take care of me i had an entir set of silver dish and plate and other necessari which in proport to those of the queen were not much bigger than what i have seen in a london toi shop for the furnitur of a babi hous these my littl nurs kept in her pocket in a silver box and gave me at meal as i want them alwai clean them herself no person dine with the queen but the two princess royal the eldest sixteen year old and the younger at that time thirteen and a month her majesti us to put a bit of meat upon on of my dish out of which i carv for myself and her divers wa to see me eat in miniatur for the queen who had inde but a weak stomach took up at on mouth as much as a dozen english farmer could eat at a meal which to me wa for some time a veri nauseou sight she would craunch the wing of a lark bone and all between her teeth although it were nine time as larg as that of a full grown turkei and put a bit of bread into her mouth as big as two twelv penni loav she drank out of a golden cup abov a hogshead at a draught her knive were twice as long as a scyth set straight upon the handl the spoon fork and other instrument were all in the same proport i rememb when glumdalclitch carri me out of curios to see some of the tabl at court where ten or a dozen of those enorm knive and fork were lift up togeth i thought i had never till then beheld so terribl a sight it is the custom that everi wednesdai which as i have observ is their sabbath the king and queen with the royal issu of both sex dine togeth in the apart of hi majesti to whom i wa now becom a great favourit and at these time my littl chair and tabl were place at hi left hand befor on of the salt cellar thi princ took a pleasur in convers with me inquir into the manner religion law govern and learn of europ wherein i gave him the best account i wa abl hi apprehens wa so clear and hi judgment so exact that he made veri wise reflect and observ upon all i said but i confess that after i had been a littl too copiou in talk of my own belov countri of our trade and war by sea and land of our schism in religion and parti in the state the prejudic of hi educ prevail so far that he could not forbear take me up in hi right hand and stroke me gentli with the other after a hearti fit of laugh ask me whether i wa a whig or tori then turn to hi first minist who wait behind him with a white staff near as tall as the mainmast of the royal sovereign he observ how contempt a thing wa human grandeur which could be mimick by such diminut insect as i and yet sai he i dare engag these creatur have their titl and distinct of honour thei contriv littl nest

with indign to hear our nobl countri the mistress of art and arm the scourg of franc the arbitress of europ the seat of virtu pieti honour and truth the pride and envi of the world so contemptu treat but as i wa not in a condit to resent injuri so upon matur thought i began to doubt whether i wa injur or no for after have been accustom sever month to the sight and convers of thi peopl and observ everi object upon which i cast mine ey to be of proportion magnitud the horror i had at first conceiv from their bulk and aspect wa so far worn off that if i had then beheld a compani of english lord and ladi in their fineri and birth dai cloth act their sever part in the most courtli manner of strut and bow and prate to sai the truth i should have been strongli tempt to laugh as much at them as the king and hi grande did at me neither inde could i forbear smile at myself when the queen us to place me upon her hand toward a look glass by which both our person appear befor me in full view togeth and there could be noth more ridicul than the comparison so that i realli began to imagin myself dwindl mani degre below my usual size noth anger and mortifi me so much as the queen s dwarf who be of the lowest statur that wa ever in that countri for i verili think he wa not full thirti feet high becam so insol at see a creatur so much beneath him that he would alwai affect to swagger and look big as he pass by me in the queen s antechamb while i wa stand on some tabl talk with the lord or ladi of the court and he seldom fail of a smart word or two upon my littl against which i could onli reveng myself by call him brother challeng him to wrestl and such reparte as ar usual in the mouth of court page on dai at dinner thi malici littl cub wa so nettl with someth i had said to him that rais himself upon the frame of her majesti s chair he took me up by the middl as i wa sit down not think ani harm and let me drop into a larg silver bowl of cream and then ran awai as fast as he could i fell over head and ear and if i had not been a good swimmer it might have gone veri hard with me for glumdalclitch in that instant happen to be at the other end of the room and the queen wa in such a fright that she want presenc of mind to assist me but my littl nurs ran to my relief and took me out after i had swallow abov a quart of cream i wa put to bed howev i receiv no other damag than the loss of a suit of cloth which wa utterli spoil the dwarf wa soundli whipt and as a farther punish forc to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown me neither wa he ever restor to favour for soon after the queen bestow him on a ladi of high qualiti so that i saw him no more to my veri great satisfact for i could not tell to what extrem such a malici urchin might have carri hi resent he had befor serv me a scurvi trick which set the queen a laugh although at the same time she wa heartili vex and would have immedi cashier him if i had not been so gener as to interced her majesti had taken a marrow bone upon her plate and after knock out the marrow place the bone again in the dish erect as it stood befor the dwarf watch hi opportun while glumdalclitch wa gone to the side board mount the stool that she stood on to take care of me at meal took me up in both hand and squeez my leg togeth wedg them into the marrow bone abov my waist where i stuck for some time and made a veri ridicul figur i believ it wa near a minut befor ani on knew what wa becom of me for i thought it below me to cry out but as princ seldom get their meat hot my leg were not scald onli my stock and breech in a sad condit the dwarf at my entreati had no other punish than a sound whip i wa frequent ralli by the queen upon account of my fear and she us to ask me whether the peopl of my countri were as great coward as myself the occas wa thi the kingdom is much pester with fli in summer and these odiou insect each of them as big as a dunstabl lark hardli gave me ani rest while i sat at dinner with their continu hum and buzz about mine ear thei would sometim alight upon my victual and leav their loathsom excrement or spawn behind which to me wa veri visibl though not to the nativ of that countri whose larg optic were not so acut as mine in view smaller object sometim thei would fix upon my nose or forehead where thei stung me to the quick smell veri offens and i could easili trace that viscou matter which our naturalist tell us enabl those creatur to walk with their feet upward upon a ceil i had much ado to defend myself against these detest anim and could not forbear start when thei came on my face it wa the common practic of the dwarf to catch a number of these insect in hi hand as schoolboi do among us and let them out suddenli under my nose on purpos to frighten me and divert the queen my remedi wa to cut them in piec with my knife as thei flew in the air wherein my dexter wa much admir i rememb on morn when glumdalclitch had set me in a box upon a window as she usual did in fair dai to give me air for i durst not ventur to let the box be hung on a nail out of the window as we do with cage in england after i had lift up on of my sash and sat down at my tabl to eat a piec of sweet cake for my breakfast abov twenti wasp allur by the smell came fly into the room hum louder than the drone of as mani bagpip some of them seiz my cake and carri it piecem awai other flew about my head and face confound me with the nois and put me in the utmost terror of their sting howev i had the courag to rise and draw my hanger and attack them in the air i dispatch four of them but the rest got awai and i present shut my window these insect were as larg as partridg i took out their sting found them an inch and a half long and as sharp as needl i carefulli preserv them all and have sinc shown them with some other curios in sever part of europ upon my return to england i gave three of them to gresham colleg and kept the fourth for myself chapter iv the countri describ a propos for correct modern map the king s palac and some account of the metropoli the author s wai of travel the chief templ describ i now intend to give the reader a short descript of thi countri as far as i travel in it which wa not abov two thousand mile round lorbrulgrud the metropoli for the queen whom i alwai attend never went farther when she accompani the king in hi progress and there staid till hi majesti return from view hi frontier the whole extent of thi princ s dominion reach about six thousand mile in length and from three to five in breadth whenc i cannot but conclud that our geograph of europ ar in a great error by suppos noth but sea between japan and california for it wa ever my opinion that there must be a balanc of earth to counterpois the great contin of tartari and therefor thei ought to correct their map and chart by join thi vast tract of land to the north west part of america wherein i shall be readi to lend them my assist the kingdom is a peninsula termin to the north east by a ridg of mountain thirti mile high which ar altogeth impass by reason of the volcano upon the top neither do the most learn know what sort of mortal inhabit beyond those mountain or whether thei be inhabit at all on the three other side it is bound by the ocean there is not on seaport in the whole kingdom and those part of the coast into which the river issu ar so full of point rock and the sea gener so rough that there is no ventur with the smallest of their boat so that these peopl ar wholli exclud from ani commerc with the rest of the world but the larg river ar full of vessel and abound with excel fish for thei seldom get ani from the sea becaus the sea fish ar of the same size with those in europ and consequ not worth catch wherebi it is manifest that natur in the product of plant and anim of so extraordinari a bulk is wholli confin to thi contin of which i leav the reason to be determin by philosoph howev now and then thei take a whale that happen to be dash against the rock which the common peopl feed on heartili these whale i have known so larg that a man could hardli carri on upon hi shoulder and sometim for curios thei ar brought in hamper to lorbrulgrud i saw on of them in a dish at the king s tabl which pass for a rariti but i did not observ he wa fond of it for i think inde the big disgust him although i have seen on somewhat larger in greenland the countri is well inhabit for it contain fifti on citi near a hundr wall town and a great number of villag to satisfi my curiou reader it mai be suffici to describ lorbrulgrud thi citi stand upon almost two equal part on each side the river that pass through it contain abov eighti thousand hous and about six hundr thousand inhabit it is in length three glomglung which make about fifti four english mile and two and a half in breadth as i measur it myself in the royal map made by the king s order which wa laid on the ground on purpos for me and extend a hundr feet i pace the diamet and circumfer sever time barefoot and comput by the scale measur it pretti exactli the king s palac is no regular edific but a heap of build about seven mile round the chief room ar gener two hundr and forti feet high and broad and long in proport a coach wa allow to glumdalclitch and me wherein her gover frequent took her out to see the town or go among the shop and i wa alwai of the parti carri in my box although the girl at my own desir would often take me out and hold me in her hand that i might more conveni view the hous and the peopl as we pass along the street i reckon our coach to be about a squar of westminst hall but not altogeth so high howev i cannot be veri exact on dai the gover order our coachman to stop at sever shop where the beggar watch their opportun crowd to the side of the coach and gave me the most horribl spectacl that ever a european ey beheld there wa a woman with a cancer in her breast swell to a monstrou size full of hole in two or three of which i could have easili crept and cover my whole bodi there wa a fellow with a wen in hi neck larger than five wool pack and anoth with a coupl of wooden leg each about twenti feet high but the most hate sight of all wa the lice crawl on their cloth i could see distinctli the limb of these vermin with my nake ey much better than those of a european lous through a microscop and their snout with which thei root like swine thei were the first i had ever beheld and i should have been curiou enough to dissect on of them if i had had proper instrument which i unluckili left behind me in the ship although inde the sight wa so nauseou that it perfectli turn my stomach besid the larg box in which i wa usual carri the queen order a smaller on to be made for me of about twelv feet squar and ten high for the conveni of travel becaus the other wa somewhat too larg for glumdalclitch s lap and cumbersom in the coach it wa made by the same artist whom i direct in the whole contriv thi travel closet wa an exact squar with a window in the middl of three of the squar and each window wa lattic with iron wire on the outsid to prevent accid in long journei on the fourth side which had no window two strong stapl were fix through which the person that carri me when i had a mind to be on horseback put a leathern belt and buckl it about hi waist thi wa alwai the offic of some grave trusti servant in whom i could confid whether i attend the king and queen in their progress or were dispos to see the garden or pai a visit to some great ladi or minist of state in the court when glumdalclitch happen to be out of order for i soon began to be known and esteem among the greatest offic i suppos more upon account of their majesti favour than ani merit of my own in journei when i wa weari of the coach a servant on horseback would buckl on my box and place it upon a cushion befor him and there i had a full prospect of the countri on three side from my three window i had in thi closet a field bed and a hammock hung from the ceil two chair and a tabl neatli screw to the floor to prevent be toss about by the agit of the hors or the coach and have been long us to sea voyag those motion although sometim veri violent did not much discompos me whenev i had a mind to see the town it wa alwai in my travel closet which glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open sedan after the fashion of the countri born by four men and attend by two other in the queen s liveri the peopl who had often heard of me were veri curiou to crowd about the sedan and the girl wa complais enough to make the bearer stop and to take me in her hand that i might be more conveni seen i wa veri desir to see the chief templ and particularli the tower belong to it which is reckon the highest in the kingdom accordingli on dai my nurs carri me thither but i mai truli sai i came back disappoint for the height is not abov three thousand feet reckon from the ground to the highest pinnacl top which allow for the differ between the size of those peopl and us in europ is no great matter for admir nor at all equal in proport if i rightli rememb to salisburi steepl but not to detract from a nation to which dure my life i shall acknowledg myself extrem oblig it must be allow that whatev thi famou tower want in height is ampli made up in beauti and strength for the wall ar near a hundr feet thick built of hewn stone whereof each is about forti feet squar and adorn on all side with statu of god and emperor cut in marbl larger than the life place in their sever nich i measur a littl finger which had fallen down from on of these statu and lai unperceiv among some rubbish and found it exactli four feet and an inch in length glumdalclitch wrap it up in her handkerchief and carri it home in her pocket to keep among other trinket of which the girl wa veri fond as children at her ag usual ar the king s kitchen is inde a nobl build vault at top and about six hundr feet high the great oven is not so wide by ten pace as the cupola at st paul s for i measur the latter on purpos after my return but if i should describ the kitchen grate the prodigi pot and kettl the joint of meat turn on the spit with mani other particular perhap i should be hardli believ at least a sever critic would be apt to think i enlarg a littl as travel ar often suspect to do to avoid which censur i fear i have run too much into the other extrem and that if thi treatis should happen to be translat into the languag of brobdingnag which is the gener name of that kingdom and transmit thither the king and hi peopl would have reason to complain that i had done them an injuri by a fals and diminut represent hi majesti seldom keep abov six hundr hors in hi stabl thei ar gener from fifti four to

happi enough in that countri if my littl had not expos me to sever ridicul and troublesom accid some of which i shall ventur to relat glumdalclitch often carri me into the garden of the court in my

down he and i be close togeth near some dwarf appl tree i must need show my wit by a silli allus between him and the tree which happen to hold in their languag as it doe in our whereupon the malici rogu watch hi opportun when i wa walk under on of them shook it directli over my head by which a dozen appl each of them near as larg as a bristol barrel came tumbl about my ear on of them hit me on the back as i chanc to stoop and knock me down flat on my face but i receiv no other hurt and the dwarf wa pardon at my desir becaus i had given the provoc anoth dai glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass plot to divert myself while she walk at some distanc with her gover in the meantim there suddenli fell such a violent shower of hail that i wa immedi by the forc of it struck to the ground and when i wa down the hailston gave me such cruel bang all over the bodi as if i had been pelt with tenni ball howev i made a shift to creep on all four and shelter myself by ly flat on my face on the lee side of a border of lemon thyme but so bruis from head to foot that i could not go abroad in ten dai neither is thi at all to be wonder at becaus natur in that countri observ the same proport through all her oper a hailston is near eighteen hundr time as larg as on in europ which i can assert upon experi have been so curiou as to weigh and measur them but a more danger accid happen to me in the same garden when my littl nurs believ she had put me in a secur place which i often entreat her to do that i might enjoi my own thought and have left my box at home to avoid the troubl of carri it went to anoth part of the garden with her gover and some ladi of her acquaint while she wa absent and out of hear a small white spaniel that belong to on of the chief garden have got by accid into the garden happen to rang near the place where i lai the dog follow the scent came directli up and take me in hi mouth ran straight to hi master wag hi tail and set me gentli on the ground by good fortun he had been so well taught that i wa carri between hi teeth without the least hurt or even tear my cloth but the poor garden who knew me well and had a great kind for me wa in a terribl fright he gentli took me up in both hi hand and ask me how i did but i wa so amaz and out of breath that i could not speak a word in a few minut i came to myself and he carri me safe to my littl nurs who by thi time had return to the place where she left me and wa in cruel agoni when i did not appear nor answer when she call she sever reprimand the garden on account of hi dog but the thing wa hush up and never known at court for the girl wa afraid of the queen s anger and truli as to myself i thought it would not be for my reput that such a stori should go about thi accid absolut determin glumdalclitch never to trust me abroad for the futur out of her sight i had been long afraid of thi resolut and therefor conceal from her some littl unlucki adventur that happen in those time when i wa left by myself onc a kite hover over the garden made a stoop at me and if i had not resolut drawn my hanger and run under a thick espali he would have certainli carri me awai in hi talon anoth time walk to the top of a fresh mole hill i fell to my neck in the hole through which that anim had cast up the earth and coin some lie not worth rememb to excus myself for spoil my cloth i likewis broke my right shin against the shell of a snail which i happen to stumbl over as i wa walk alon and think on poor england i cannot tell whether i were more pleas or mortifi to observ in those solitari walk that the smaller bird did not appear to be at all afraid of me but would hop about within a yard s distanc look for worm and other food with as much indiffer and secur as if no creatur at all were near them i rememb a thrush had the confid to snatch out of my hand with hi bill a of cake that glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast when i attempt to catch ani of these bird thei would boldli turn against me endeavour to peck my finger which i durst not ventur within their reach and then thei would hop back unconcern to hunt for worm or snail as thei did befor but on dai i took a thick cudgel and threw it with all my strength so luckili at a linnet that i knock him down and seiz him by the neck with both my hand ran with him in triumph to my nurs howev the bird who had onli been stun recov himself gave me so mani box with hi wing on both side of my head and bodi though i held him at arm s length and wa out of the reach of hi claw that i wa twenti time think to let him go but i wa soon reliev by on of our servant who wrung off the bird s neck and i had him next dai for dinner by the queen s command thi linnet as near as i can rememb seem to be somewhat larger than an english swan the maid of honour often invit glumdalclitch to their apart and desir she would bring me along with her on purpos to have the pleasur of see and touch me thei would often strip me nake from top to toe and lai me at full length in their bosom wherewith i wa much disgust becaus to sai the truth a veri offens smell came from their skin which i do not mention or intend to the disadvantag of those excel ladi for whom i have all manner of respect but i conceiv that my sens wa more acut in proport to my littl and that those illustri person were no more disagre to their lover or to each other than peopl of the same qualiti ar with us in england and after all i found their natur smell wa much more support than when thei us perfum under which i immedi swoon awai i cannot forget that an intim friend of mine in lilliput took the freedom in a warm dai when i had us a good deal of exercis to complain of a strong smell about me although i am as littl faulti that wai as most of my sex but i suppos hi faculti of smell wa as nice with regard to me as mine wa to that of thi peopl upon thi point i cannot forbear do justic to the queen my mistress and glumdalclitch my nurs whose person were as sweet as those of ani ladi in england that which gave me most uneasi among these maid of honour when my nurs carri me to visit then wa to see them us me without ani manner of ceremoni like a creatur who had no sort of consequ for thei would strip themselv to the skin and put on their smock in my presenc while i wa place on their toilet directli befor their nake bodi which i am sure to me wa veri far from be a tempt sight or from give me ani other emot than those of horror and disgust their skin appear so coars and uneven so various colour when i saw them near with a mole here and there as broad as a trencher and hair hang from it thicker than packthread to sai noth farther concern the rest of their person neither did thei at all scrupl while i wa by to discharg what thei had drank to the quantiti of at least two hogshead in a vessel that held abov three tun the handsomest among these maid of honour a pleasant frolicsom girl of sixteen would sometim set me astrid upon on of her nippl with mani other trick wherein the reader will excus me for not be over particular but i wa so much displeas that i entreat glumdalclitch to contriv some excus for not see that young ladi ani more on dai a young gentleman who wa nephew to my nurs s gover came and press them both to see an execut it wa of a man who had murder on of that gentleman s intim acquaint glumdalclitch wa prevail on to be of the compani veri much against her inclin for she wa natur tender heart and as for myself although i abhor such kind of spectacl yet my curios tempt me to see someth that i thought must be extraordinari the malefactor wa fix in a chair upon a scaffold erect for that purpos and hi head cut off at on blow with a sword of about forti feet long the vein and arteri spout up such a prodigi quantiti of blood and so high in the air that the great jet d eau at versail wa not equal to it for the time it last and the head when it fell on the scaffold floor gave such a bounc as made me start although i wa at least half an english mile distant the queen who often us to hear me talk of my sea voyag and took all occas to divert me when i wa melancholi ask me whether i understood how to handl a sail or an oar and whether a littl exercis of row might not be conveni for my health i answer that i understood both veri well for although my proper employ had been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship yet often upon a pinch i wa forc to work like a common marin but i could not see how thi could be done in their countri where the smallest wherri wa equal to a first rate man of war among us and such a boat as i could manag would never live in ani of their river her majesti said if i would contriv a boat her own joiner should make it and she would provid a place for me to sail in the fellow wa an ingeni workman and by my instruct in ten dai finish a pleasur boat with all it tackl abl conveni to hold eight european when it wa finish the queen wa so delight that she ran with it in her lap to the king who order it to be put into a cistern full of water with me in it by wai of trial where i could not manag my two scull or littl oar for want of room but the queen had befor contriv anoth project she order the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundr feet long fifti broad and eight deep which be well pitch to prevent leak wa place on the floor along the wall in an outer room of the palac it had a cock near the bottom to let out the water when it began to grow stale and two servant could easili fill it in half an hour here i often us to row for my own divers as well as that of the queen and her ladi who thought themselv well entertain with my skill and agil sometim i would put up my sail and then my busi wa onli to steer while the ladi gave me a gale with their fan and when thei were weari some of their page would blow my sail forward with their breath while i show my art by steer starboard or larboard as i pleas when i had done glumdalclitch alwai carri back my boat into her closet and hung it on a nail to dry in thi exercis i onc met an accid which had like to have cost me my life for on of the page have put my boat into the trough the gover who attend glumdalclitch veri offici lift me up to place me in the boat but i happen to slip through her finger and should infal have fallen down forti feet upon the floor if by the luckiest chanc in the world i had not been stop by a cork pin that stuck in the good gentlewoman s stomach the head of the pin pass between my shirt and the waistband of my breech and thu i wa held by the middl in the air till glumdalclitch ran to my relief anoth time on of the servant whose offic it wa to fill my trough everi third dai with fresh water wa so careless as to let a huge frog not perceiv it slip out of hi pail the frog lai conceal till i wa put into my boat but then see a rest place climb up and made it lean so much on on side that i wa forc to balanc it with all my weight on the other to prevent overturn when the frog wa got in it hop at onc half the length of the boat and then over my head backward and forward daub my face and cloth with it odiou slime the larg of it featur made it appear the most deform anim that can be conceiv howev i desir glumdalclitch to let me deal with it alon i bang it a good while with on of my scull and at last forc it to leap out of the boat but the greatest danger i ever underw in that kingdom wa from a monkei who belong to on of the clerk of the kitchen glumdalclitch had lock me up in her closet while she went somewher upon busi or a visit the weather be veri warm the closet window wa left open as well as the window and the door of my bigger box in which i usual live becaus of it larg and conveni as i sat quietli medit at my tabl i heard someth bounc in at the closet window and skip about from on side to the other whereat although i wa much alarm yet i ventur to look out but not stir from my seat and then i saw thi frolicsom anim frisk and leap up and down till at last he came to my box which he seem to view with great pleasur and curios peep in at the door and everi window i retreat to the farther corner of my room or box but the monkei look in at everi side put me in such a fright that i want presenc of mind to conceal myself under the bed as i might easili have done after some time spent in peep grin and chatter he at last espi me and reach on of hi paw in at the door as a cat doe when she plai with a mous although i often shift place to avoid him he at length seiz the lappet of my coat which be made of that countri silk wa veri thick and strong and drag me out he took me up in hi right fore foot and held me as a nurs doe a child she is go to suckl just as i have seen the same sort of creatur do with a kitten in europ and when i offer to struggl he squeez me so hard that i thought it more prudent to submit i have good reason to believ that he took me for a young on of hi own speci by hi often stroke my face veri gentli with hi other paw in these divers he wa interrupt by a nois at the closet door as if somebodi were open it whereupon he suddenli leap up to the window at which he had come

out the poor girl wa almost distract that quarter of the palac wa all in an uproar the servant ran for ladder the monkei wa seen by hundr in the court sit upon the ridg of a build hold me like a babi in on of hi forepaw and feed me with the other by cram into my mouth some victual he had squeez out of the bag on on side of hi chap and pat me when i would not eat whereat mani of the rabbl below could not forbear laugh neither do i think thei justli ought to be blame for without question the sight wa ridicul enough to everi bodi but myself some of the peopl threw up stone hope to drive the monkei down but thi wa strictli forbidden or els veri probabl my brain had been dash out the ladder were now appli and mount by sever men which the monkei observ and find himself almost encompass not be abl to make speed enough with hi three leg let me drop on a ridg tile and made hi escap here i sat for some time five hundr yard from the ground expect everi moment to be blown down by the wind or to fall by my own giddi and come tumbl over and over from the ridg to the eav but an honest lad on of my nurs s footmen climb up and put me into hi breech pocket brought me down safe i wa almost choke with the filthi stuff the monkei had cram down my throat but my dear littl nurs pick it out of my mouth with a small needl and then i fell a vomit which gave me great relief yet i wa so weak and bruis in the side with the squeez given me by thi odiou anim that i wa forc to keep my bed a fortnight the king queen and all the court sent everi dai to inquir after my health and her majesti made me sever visit dure my sick the monkei wa kill and an order made that no such anim should be kept about the palac when i attend the king after my recoveri to return him thank for hi favour he wa pleas to ralli me a good deal upon thi adventur he ask me what my thought and specul were while i lai in the monkei s paw how i like the victual he gave me hi manner of feed and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpen my stomach he desir to know what i would have done upon such an occas in my own countri i told hi majesti that in europ we had no monkei except such as were brought for curios from other place and so small that i could deal with a dozen of them togeth if thei presum to attack me and as for that monstrou anim with whom i wa so late engag it wa inde as larg as an eleph if my fear had suffer me to think so far as to make us of my hanger look fierc and clap my hand on the hilt as i spoke when he poke hi paw into my chamber perhap i should have given him such a wound as would have made him glad to withdraw it with more hast than he put it in thi i deliv in a firm tone like a person who wa jealou lest hi courag should be call in question howev my speech produc noth els besid a laud laughter which all the respect due to hi majesti from those about him could not make them contain thi made me reflect how vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among those who ar out of all degre of equal or comparison with him and yet i have seen the moral of my own behaviour veri frequent in england sinc my return where a littl contempt varlet without the least titl to birth person wit or common sens shall presum to look with import and put himself upon a foot with the greatest person of the kingdom i wa everi dai furnish the court with some ridicul stori and glumdalclitch although she love me to excess yet wa arch enough to inform the queen whenev i commit ani folli that she thought would be divert to her majesti the girl who had been out of order wa carri by her gover to take the air about an hour s distanc or thirti mile from town thei alight out of the coach near a small foot path in a field and glumdalclitch set down my travel box i went out of it to walk there wa a cow dung in the path and i must need try my activ by attempt to leap over it i took a run but unfortun jump short and found myself just in the middl up to my knee i wade through with some difficulti and on of the footmen wipe me as clean as he could with hi handkerchief for i wa filthili bemir and my nurs confin me to my box till we return home where the queen wa soon inform of what had pass and the footmen spread it about the court so that all the mirth for some dai wa at my expens chapter vi sever contriv of the author to pleas the king and queen he show hi skill in music the king inquir into the state of england which the author relat to him the king s observ thereon i us to attend the king s leve onc or twice a week and had often seen him under the barber s hand which inde wa at first veri terribl to behold for the razor wa almost twice as long as an ordinari scyth hi majesti accord to the custom of the countri wa onli shave twice a week i onc prevail on the barber to give me some of the sud or lather out of which i pick forti or fifti of the strongest stump of hair i then took a piec of fine wood and cut it like the back of a comb make sever hole in it at equal distanc with as small a needl as i could get from glumdalclitch i fix in the stump so artifici scrape and slope them with my knife toward the point that i made a veri toler comb which wa a season suppli my own be so much broken in the teeth that it wa almost useless neither did i know ani artist in that countri so nice and exact as would undertak to make me anoth and thi put me in mind of an amus wherein i spent mani of my leisur hour i desir the queen s woman to save for me the comb of her majesti s hair whereof in time i got a good quantiti and consult with my friend the cabinet maker who had receiv gener order to do littl job for me i direct him to make two chair frame no larger than those i had in my box and to bore littl hole with a fine awl round those part where i design the back and seat through these hole i wove the strongest hair i could pick out just after the manner of cane chair in england when thei were finish i made a present of them to her majesti who kept them in her cabinet and us to show them for curios as inde thei were the wonder of everi on that beheld them the queen would have me sit upon on of these chair but i absolut refus to obei her protest i would rather die than place a dishonour part of my bodi on those preciou hair that onc adorn her majesti s head of these hair as i had alwai a mechan geniu i likewis made a neat littl purs about five feet long with her majesti s name deciph in gold letter which i gave to glumdalclitch by the queen s consent to sai the truth it wa more for show than us be not of strength to bear the weight of the larger coin and therefor she kept noth in it but some littl toi that girl ar fond of the king who delight in music had frequent concert at court to which i wa sometim carri and set in my box on a tabl to hear them but the nois wa so great that i could hardli distinguish the tune i am confid that all the drum and trumpet of a royal armi beat and sound togeth just at your ear could not equal it my practic wa to have my box remov from the place where the perform sat as far as i could then to shut the door and window of it and draw the window curtain after which i found their music not disagre i had learn in my youth to plai a littl upon the spinet glumdalclitch kept on in her chamber and a master attend twice a week to teach her i call it a spinet becaus it somewhat resembl that instrument and wa plai upon in the same manner a fanci came into my head that i would entertain the king and queen with an english tune upon thi instrument but thi appear extrem difficult for the spinet wa near sixti feet long each kei be almost a foot wide so that with my arm extend i could not reach to abov five kei and to press them down requir a good smart stroke with my fist which would be too great a labour and to no purpos the method i contriv wa thi i prepar two round stick about the big of common cudgel thei were thicker at on end than the other and i cover the thicker end with piec of a mous s skin that by rap on them i might neither damag the top of the kei nor interrupt the sound befor the spinet a bench wa place about four feet below the kei and i wa put upon the bench i ran sidel upon it that wai and thi as fast as i could bang the proper kei with my two stick and made a shift to plai a jig to the great satisfact of both their majesti but it wa the most violent exercis i ever underw and yet i could not strike abov sixteen kei nor consequ plai the bass and trebl togeth as other artist do which wa a great disadvantag to my perform the king who as i befor observ wa a princ of excel understand would frequent order that i should be brought in my box and set upon the tabl in hi closet he would then command me to bring on of my chair out of the box and sit down within three yard distanc upon the top of the cabinet which brought me almost to a level with hi face in thi manner i had sever convers with him i on dai took the freedom to tell hi majesti that the contempt he discov toward europ and the rest of the world did not seem answer to those excel qualiti of mind that he wa master of that reason did not extend itself with the bulk of the bodi on the contrari we observ in our countri that the tallest person were usual the least provid with it that among other anim bee and ant had the reput of more industri art and sagac than mani of the larger kind and that as inconsider as he took me to be i hope i might live to do hi majesti some signal servic the king heard me with attent and began to conceiv a much better opinion of me than he had ever befor he desir i would give him as exact an account of the govern of england as i possibl could becaus as fond as princ commonli ar of their own custom for so he conjectur of other monarch by my former discours he should be glad to hear of ani thing that might deserv imit imagin with thyself courteou reader how often i then wish for the tongu of demosthen or cicero that might have enabl me to celebr the prais

ani other particular which i thought might redound to the honour of my countri and i finish all with a brief histor account of affair and event in england for about a hundr year past thi convers wa not end under five audienc each of sever hour and the king heard the whole with great attent frequent take note of what i spoke as well as memorandum of what question he intend to ask me when i had put an end to these long discourc hi majesti in a sixth audienc consult hi note propos mani doubt queri and object upon everi articl he ask what method were us to cultiv the mind and bodi of our young

told me that the knowledg of our conduct might be us to him and he could not be deceiv in hi calcul but if what i told him were true he wa still at a loss how a kingdom could run out of it estat like a privat person he ask me who were our creditor and where we found monei to pai them he wonder to hear me talk of such chargeabl and expens war that certainli we must be a quarrelsom peopl or live

it would be hard inde if so remot a princ s notion of virtu and vice were to be offer as a standard for all mankind to confirm what i have now said and further to show the miser effect of a confin educ i shall here insert a passag which will hardli obtain belief in hope to ingrati myself further into hi majesti s favour i told him of an invent discov between three and four hundr year ago to make a certain powder into a heap of which the smallest spark of fire fall would kindl the whole in a moment although it were as big as a mountain and make it all fly up in the air togeth with a nois and agit greater than thunder that a proper quantiti of thi powder ram into a hollow tube of brass or iron accord to it big would drive a ball of iron or lead with such violenc and speed as noth wa abl to sustain it forc that the largest ball thu discharg would not onli destroi whole rank of an armi at onc but batter the strongest wall to the ground sink down ship with a thousand men in each to the bottom of the sea and when link togeth by a chain would cut through mast and rig divid hundr of bodi in the middl and lai all wast befor them that we often put thi powder into larg hollow ball of iron and discharg them by an engin into some citi we were besieg which would rip up the pavement tear the hous to piec burst and throw splinter on everi side dash out the brain of all who came near that i knew the ingredi veri well which were cheap and common i understood the manner of compound them and could direct hi workmen how to make those tube of a size proportion to all other thing in hi majesti s kingdom and the largest need not be abov a hundr feet long twenti or thirti of which tube charg with the proper quantiti of powder and ball would batter down the wall of the strongest town in hi dominion in a few hour or destroi the whole metropoli if ever it should pretend to disput hi absolut command thi i humbl offer to hi majesti as a small tribut of acknowledg in turn for so mani mark that i had receiv of hi royal favour and protect the king wa struck with horror at the descript i had given of those terribl engin and the propos i had made he wa amaz how so impot and grovel an

those destruct machin whereof he said some evil geniu enemi to mankind must have been the first contriv as for himself he protest that although few thing delight him so much as new discoveri in art or in natur yet he would rather lose half hi kingdom than be privi to such a secret which he command me as i valu ani life never to mention ani more a strang effect of narrow principl and view that a princ possess of everi qualiti which procur vener love and esteem of strong part great wisdom and profound learn endow with admir talent and almost ador by hi subject should from a nice unnecessari scrupl whereof in europ we can have no concept let slip an opportun put into hi hand that would have made him absolut master of the live the liberti and the fortun of hi peopl neither do i sai thi with the least intent to detract from the mani virtu of that excel king whose charact i am sensibl will on thi account be veri much lessen in the opinion of an english reader but i take thi defect among them to have risen from their ignor by not have hitherto reduc polit into a scienc as the more acut wit of europ have done for i rememb veri well in a discours on dai with the king when i happen to sai there were sever thousand book among us written upon the art of govern it gave him directli contrari to my intent a veri mean opinion of our understand he profess both to abomin and despis all mysteri refin and intrigu either in a princ or a minist he could not tell what i meant by secret of state where an enemi or some rival nation were not in the case he confin the knowledg of govern within veri narrow bound to common sens and reason to justic and leniti to the speedi determin of civil and crimin caus with some other obviou topic which ar not worth consid and he gave it for hi opinion that whoever could make two ear of corn or two blade of grass to grow upon a spot of ground where onli on grew befor would deserv better of mankind and do more essenti servic to hi countri than the whole race of politician put togeth the learn of thi peopl is veri defect consist onli in moral histori poetri and mathemat wherein thei must be allow to excel but the last of these is wholli appli to what mai be us in life to the improv of agricultur and all mechan art so that among us it would be littl esteem and as to idea entiti abstract and transcendent i could never drive the least concept into their head no law in that countri must exce in word the number of letter in their alphabet which consist onli of two and twenti but inde few of them extend even to that length thei ar express in the most plain and simpl term wherein those peopl ar not mercuri enough to discov abov on interpret and to write a comment upon ani law is a capit crime as to the decis of civil caus or proceed against crimin their preced ar so few that thei have littl reason to boast of ani extraordinari skill in either thei have had the art of print as well as the chines time out of mind but their librari ar not veri larg for that of the king which is reckon the largest doe not amount to abov a thousand volum place in a galleri of twelv hundr feet long whenc i had liberti to borrow what book i pleas the queen s joiner had contriv in on of glumdalclitch s room a kind of wooden machin five and twenti feet high form like a stand ladder the step were each fifti feet long it wa inde a moveabl pair of stair the lowest end place at ten feet distanc from the wall of the chamber the book i had a mind to read wa put up lean against the wall i first mount to the upper step of the ladder and turn my face toward the book began at the top of the page and so walk to the right and left about eight or ten pace accord to the length of the line till i had gotten a littl below the level of mine ey and then descend gradual till i came to the bottom after which i mount again and began the other page in the same manner and so turn over the leaf which i could easili do with both my hand for it wa as thick and stiff as a pasteboard and in the largest folio not abov eighteen or twenti feet long their style is clear masculin and smooth but not florid for thei avoid noth more than multipli unnecessari word or us variou express i have perus mani of their book especi those in histori and moral among the rest i wa much divert with a littl old treatis which alwai lai in glumdalclitch s bed chamber and belong to her gover a grave elderli gentlewoman who dealt in write of moral and devot the book treat of the weak of human kind and is in littl esteem except among the women and the vulgar howev i wa curiou to see what an author of that countri could sai upon such a subject thi writer went through all the usual topic of european moralist show how diminut contempt and helpless an anim wa man in hi own natur how unabl to defend himself from inclem of the air or the furi of wild beast how much he wa excel by on creatur in strength by anoth in speed by a third in foresight by a fourth in industri he ad that natur wa degener in these latter declin ag of the world and could now produc onli small abort birth in comparison of those in ancient time he said it wa veri reason to think not onli that the speci of men were origin much larger but also that there must have been giant in former ag which as it is assert by histori and tradit so it ha been confirm by huge bone and skull casual dug up in sever part of the kingdom far exceed the common dwindl race of men in our dai he argu that the veri law of natur absolut requir we should have been made in the begin of a size more larg and robust not so liabl to destruct from everi littl accid of a tile fall from a hous or a stone cast from the hand of a boi or be drown in a littl brook from thi wai of reason the author drew sever moral applic us in the conduct of life but needless here to repeat for my own part i could not avoid reflect how univers thi talent wa spread of draw lectur in moral or inde rather matter of discont and repin from the quarrel we rais with natur and i believ upon a strict inquiri those quarrel might be shown as ill ground among us as thei ar among that peopl as to their militari affair thei boast that the king s armi consist of a hundr and seventi six thousand foot and thirti two thousand hors if that mai be call an armi which is made up of tradesmen in the sever citi and farmer in the countri whose command ar onli the nobil and gentri without pai or reward thei ar inde perfect enough in their exercis and under veri good disciplin wherein i saw no great merit for how should it be otherwis where everi farmer is under the command of hi own landlord and everi citizen under that of the princip men in hi own citi chosen after the manner of venic by ballot i have often seen the militia of lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercis in a great field near the citi of twenti mile squar thei were in all not abov twenti five thousand foot and six thousand hors but it wa imposs for me to comput their number consid the space of ground thei took up a cavali mount on a larg steed might be about nineti feet high i have seen thi whole bodi of hors upon a word of command draw their sword at onc and brandish them in the air imagin can figur noth so grand so surpris and so astonish it look as if ten thousand flash of lightn were dart at the same time from everi quarter of the sky i wa curiou to know how thi princ to whose dominion there is no access from ani other countri came to think of armi or to teach hi peopl the practic of militari disciplin but i wa soon inform both by convers and read their histori for in the cours of mani ag thei have been troubl with the same diseas to which the whole race of mankind is subject the nobil often contend for power the peopl for liberti and the king for absolut dominion all which howev happili temper by the law of that kingdom have been sometim violat by each of the three parti and have more than onc occas civil war the last whereof wa happili put an end to by thi princ s grand father in a gener composit and the militia then settl with common consent ha been ever sinc kept in the strictest duti chapter viii the king and queen make a progress to the frontier the author attend them the manner in which he leav the countri veri particularli relat he return to england i had alwai a strong impuls that i should some time recov my liberti though it wa imposs to conjectur by what mean or to form ani project with the least hope of succeed the ship in which i sail wa the first ever known to be driven within sight of that coast and the king had given strict order that if at ani time anoth appear it should be taken ashor and with all it crew and passeng brought in a tumbril to lorbrulgrud he wa strongli bent to get me a woman of my own size by whom i might propag the breed but i think i should rather have di than undergon the disgrac of leav a poster to be kept in cage like tame canari bird and perhap in time sold about the kingdom to person of qualiti for curios i wa inde treat with much kind i wa the favourit of a great king and queen and the delight of the whole court but it wa upon such a foot as ill becam the

afraid of be trod to death like a frog or a young puppi but my deliver came sooner than i expect and in a manner not veri common the whole stori and circumst of which i shall faithfulli relat i had now been two year in thi countri and about the begin of the third glumdalclitch and i attend the king and queen in a progress to the south coast of the kingdom i wa carri as usual in my travel box which as i have alreadi describ wa a veri conveni closet of twelv feet wide and i had order a hammock to be fix by silken rope from the four corner at the top to break the jolt when a servant carri me befor him on horseback as i sometim desir and would often sleep in my hammock while we were upon the road on the roof of my closet not directli over the middl of the hammock i order the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot squar to give me air in hot weather as i slept which hole i shut at pleasur with a board that drew backward and forward through a groov when we came to our journei s end the king thought proper to pass a few dai at a palac he ha near flanflasn a citi within eighteen english mile of the seasid glumdalclitch and i were much fatigu i had gotten a small cold but the poor girl wa so ill as to be confin to her chamber i long to see the ocean which must be the onli scene of my escap if ever it should happen i pretend to be wors than i realli wa and desir leav to take the fresh air of the sea with a page whom i wa veri fond of and who had sometim been trust with me i shall never forget with what unwilling glumdalclitch consent nor the strict charg she gave the page to be care of me burst at the same time into a flood of tear as if she had some forbod of what wa to happen the boi took me out in my box about half an hour walk from the palac toward the rock on the sea shore i order him to set me down and lift up on of my sash cast mani a wist melancholi look toward the sea i found myself not veri well and told the page that i had a mind to take a nap in my hammock which i hope would do me good i got in and the boi shut the window close down to keep out the cold i soon fell asleep and all i can conjectur is while i slept the page think no danger could happen went among the rock to look for bird egg have befor observ him from my window search about and pick up on or two in the cleft be that as it will i found myself suddenli awak with a violent pull upon the ring which wa fasten at the top of my box for the conveni of carriag i felt my box rais veri high in the air and then born forward with prodigi speed the first jolt had like to have shaken me out of my hammock but afterward the motion wa easi enough i call out sever time as loud as i could rais my voic but all to no purpos i look toward my window and could see noth but the cloud and sky i heard a nois just over my head like the clap of wing and then began to perceiv the woful condit i wa in that some eagl had got the ring of my box in hi beak with an intent to let it fall on a rock like a tortois in a shell and then pick out my bodi and devour it for the sagac and smell of thi bird enabl him to discov hi quarri at a great distanc though better conceal than i could be within a two inch board in a littl time i observ the nois and flutter of wing to increas veri fast and my box wa toss up and down like a sign in a windi dai i heard sever bang or buffet as i thought given to the eagl for such i am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in hi beak and then all on a sudden felt myself fall perpendicularli down for abov a minut but with such incred swift that i almost lost my breath my fall wa stop by a terribl squash that sound louder to my ear than the cataract of niagara after which i wa quit in the dark for anoth minut and then my box began to rise so high that i could see light from the top of the window i now perceiv i wa fallen into the sea my box by the weight of my bodi the good that were in and the broad plate of iron fix for strength at the four corner of the top and bottom float about five feet deep in water i did then and do now suppos that the eagl which flew awai with my box wa pursu by two or three other and forc to let me drop while he defend himself against the rest who hope to share in the prei the plate of iron fasten at the bottom of the box for those were the strongest preserv the balanc while it fell and hinder it from be broken on the surfac of the water everi joint of it wa well groov and the door did not move on hing but up and down like a sash which kept my closet so tight that veri littl water came in i got with much difficulti out of my hammock have first ventur to draw back the slip board on the roof alreadi mention contriv on purpos to let in air for want of which i found myself almost stifl how often did i then wish myself with my dear glumdalclitch from whom on singl hour had so far divid me and i mai sai with truth that in the midst of my own misfortun i could not forbear lament my poor nurs the grief she would suffer for my loss the displeasur of the queen and the ruin of her fortun perhap mani travel have not been under greater difficulti and distress than i wa at thi junctur expect everi moment to see my box dash to piec or at least overset by the first violent blast or rise wave a breach in on singl pane of glass would have been immedi death nor could ani thing have preserv the window but the strong lattic wire place on the outsid against accid in travel i saw the water ooz in at sever cranni although the leak were not consider and i endeavour to stop them as well as i could i wa not abl to lift up the roof of my closet which otherwis i certainli should have done and sat on the top of it where i might at least preserv myself some hour longer than by be shut up as i mai call it in the hold or if i escap these danger for a dai or two what could i expect but a miser death of cold and hunger i wa four hour under these circumst expect and inde wish everi moment to be my last i have alreadi told the reader that there were two strong stapl fix upon that side of my box which had no window and into which the servant who us to carri me on horseback would put a leathern belt and buckl it about hi waist be in thi disconsol state i heard or at least thought i heard some kind of grate nois on that side of my box where the stapl were fix and soon after i began to fanci that the box wa pull or tow along the sea for i now and then felt a sort of tug which made the wave rise near the top of my window leav me almost in the dark thi gave me some faint hope of relief although i wa not abl to imagin how it could be brought about i ventur to unscrew on of my chair which were alwai fasten to the floor and have made a hard shift to screw it down again directli under the slip board that i had late open i mount on the chair and put my mouth as near as i could to the hole i call for help in a loud voic and in all the languag i understood i then fasten my handkerchief to a stick i usual carri and thrust it up the hole wave it sever time in the air that if ani boat or ship were near the seamen might conjectur some unhappi mortal to be shut up in the box i found no effect from all i could do but plainli perceiv my closet to be move along and in the space of an hour or better that side of the box where the stapl were and had no window struck against someth that wa hard i apprehend it to be a rock and found myself toss more than ever i plainli heard a nois upon the cover of my closet like that of a cabl and the grate of it as it pass through the ring i then found myself hoist up by degre at least three feet higher than i wa befor whereupon i again thrust up my stick and handkerchief call for help till i wa almost hoars in return to which i heard a great shout repeat three time give me such transport of joi as ar not to be conceiv but by those who feel them i now heard a trampl over my head and somebodi call through the hole with a loud voic in the english tongu if there be ani bodi below let them speak i answer i wa an englishman drawn by ill fortun into the greatest calam that ever ani creatur underw and beg by all that wa move to be deliv out of the dungeon i wa in the voic repli i wa safe for my box wa fasten to their ship and the carpent should immedi come and saw a hole in the cover larg enough to pull me out i answer that wa needless and would take up too much time for there wa no more to be done but let on of the crew put hi finger into the ring and take the box out of the sea into the ship and so into the captain s cabin some of them upon hear me talk so wildli thought i wa mad other laugh for inde it never came into my head that i wa now got among peopl of my own statur and strength the carpent came and in a few minut saw a passag about four feet squar then let down a small ladder upon which i mount and thenc wa taken into the ship in a veri weak condit the sailor were all in amaz and ask me a thousand question which i had no inclin to answer i wa equal confound at the sight of so mani pigmi for such i took them to be after have so long accustom mine ey to the monstrou object i had left but the captain mr thoma wilcock an honest worthi shropshir man observ i wa readi to faint took me into hi cabin gave me a cordial to comfort me and made me turn in upon hi own bed advis me to take a littl rest of which i had great need befor i went to sleep i gave him to understand that i had some valuabl furnitur in my box too good to be lost a fine hammock a handsom field bed two chair a tabl and a cabinet that my closet wa hung on all side or rather quilt with silk and cotton that if he would let on of the crew bring my closet into hi cabin i would open it there befor him and show him my good the captain hear me utter these absurd conclud i wa rave howev i suppos to pacifi me he promis to give order as i desir and go upon deck sent some of hi men down into my closet whenc as i afterward found thei drew up all my good and strip off the quilt but the chair cabinet and bedstead be screw to the floor were much damag by the ignor of the seamen who tore them up by forc then thei knock off some of the board for the us of the ship and when thei had got all thei had a mind for let the hull drop into the sea which by reason of mani breach made in the bottom and side sunk to right and inde i wa glad not to have been a spectat of the havoc thei made becaus i am confid it would have sensibl touch me by bring former passag into my mind which i would rather have forgot i slept some hour but perpetu disturb with dream of the place i had left and the danger i had escap howev upon wake i found myself much recov it wa now about eight o clock at night and the captain order supper immedi think i had alreadi fast too long he entertain me with great kind observ me not to look wildli or talk inconsist and when we were left alon desir i would give him a relat of my travel and by what accid i came to be set adrift in that monstrou wooden chest he said that about twelv o clock at noon as he wa look through hi glass he spi it at a distanc and thought it wa a sail which he had a mind to make be not much out of hi cours in hope of bui some biscuit hi own begin to fall short that upon come nearer and find hi error he sent out hi long boat to discov what it wa that hi men came back in a fright swear thei had seen a swim hous that he laugh at their folli and went himself in the boat order hi men to take a strong cabl along with them that the weather be calm he row round me sever time observ my window and wire lattic that defend them that he discov two stapl upon on side which wa all of board without ani passag for light he then command hi men to row up to that side and fasten a cabl to on of the stapl order them to tow my chest as thei call it toward the ship when it wa there he gave direct to fasten anoth cabl to the ring fix in the cover and to rais up my chest with pullei which all the sailor were not abl to do abov two or three feet he said thei saw my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole and conclud that some unhappi man must be shut up in the caviti i ask whether he or the crew had seen ani prodigi bird in the air about the time he first discov me to which he answer that discours thi matter with the sailor while i wa asleep on of them said he had observ three eagl fly toward the north but remark noth of their be larger than the usual size which i suppos must be imput to the great height thei were at and he could not guess the reason of my question i then ask the captain how far he reckon we might be from land he said by the best comput he could make we were at least a hundr leagu i assur him that he must be mistaken by almost half for i had not left the countri whenc i came abov two hour befor i drop into the sea whereupon he began again to think that my brain wa disturb of which he gave me a hint and advis me to go to bed in a cabin he had provid i assur him i wa well refresh with hi good entertain and compani and as much in my sens as ever i wa in my life he then grew seriou and desir to ask me freeli whether i were not troubl in my mind by the conscious of some enorm crime for which i wa punish at the command of some princ by expos me in that chest as great crimin in other countri have been forc to sea in a leaki vessel without provis for although he should be sorri to have taken so ill a man into hi ship yet he would engag hi word to set me safe ashor in the first port where we arriv he ad that hi suspicion were much increas by some veri absurd speech i had deliv at first to hi sailor and afterward to himself in relat to my closet or chest as well as by my odd look and behaviour while i wa at supper i beg hi patienc to hear me tell my stori which i faithfulli did from the last time i left england to the moment he first discov me and as truth alwai forc it wai into ration mind so thi honest worthi gentleman who had some tinctur of learn and veri good sens wa immedi convinc of my candour and verac but further to confirm all i had said i entreat him to give order that my cabinet should be brought of which i had the kei in my pocket for he had alreadi inform me how the seamen dispos of my closet i open it in hi own presenc and show him the small collect of rariti i made in the countri from which i had been so strang deliv there wa the comb i had contriv out of the stump of the king s beard and anoth of the same materi but fix into a pare of her majesti s thumb nail which serv for the back there wa a collect of needl and pin from a foot to half a yard long four wasp sting like joiner s tack some comb of the queen s hair a gold ring which on dai she made me a present of in a most oblig manner take it from her littl finger and throw it over my head like a collar i desir the captain would pleas to accept thi ring in return for hi civil which he absolut refus i show him a corn that i had cut off with my own hand from a maid of honour s toe it wa about the big of kentish pippin and grown so hard that when i return england i got it hollow into a cup and set in silver lastli i desir him to see the breech i had then on which were made of a mous s skin i could forc noth on him but a footman s tooth which i observ him to examin with great curios and found he had a fanci for it he receiv it with abund of thank more than such a trifl could deserv it wa drawn by an unskil surgeon in a mistak from on of glumdalclitch s men who wa afflict with the tooth ach but it wa as sound as ani in hi head i got it clean and put it into my cabinet it wa about a foot long and four inch in diamet the captain wa veri well satisfi with thi plain relat i had given him and said he hope when we return to england i would oblig the world by put it on paper and make it public my answer wa that we were overstock with book of travel that noth could now pass which wa not extraordinari wherein i doubt some author less consult truth than their own vaniti or interest or the divers of ignor reader that my stori could contain littl besid common event without those ornament descript of strang plant tree bird and other anim or of the barbar custom and idolatri of savag peopl with which most writer abound howev i thank him for hi good opinion and promis to take the matter into my thought he said he wonder at on thing veri much which wa to hear me speak so loud ask me whether the king or queen of that countri were thick of hear i told him it wa what i had been us to for abov two year past and that i admir as much at the voic of him and hi men who seem to me onli to whisper and yet i could hear them well enough but when i spoke in that countri it wa like a man talk in the street to anoth look out from the top of a steepl unless when i wa place on a tabl or held in ani person s hand i told him i had likewis observ anoth thing that when i first got into the ship and the sailor stood all about me i thought thei were the most littl contempt creatur i had ever beheld for inde while i wa in that princ s countri i could never endur to look in a glass after mine ey had been accustom to such prodigi object becaus the comparison gave me so despic a conceit of myself the captain said that while we were at supper he observ me to look at everi thing with a sort of wonder and that i often seem hardli abl to contain my laughter which he knew not well how to take but imput it to some disord in my brain i answer it wa veri true and i wonder how i could forbear when i saw hi dish of the size of a silver three penc a leg of pork hardli a mouth a cup not so big as a nut shell and so i went on describ the rest of hi household stuff and provis after the same manner for although he queen had order a littl equipag of all thing necessari for me while i wa in her servic yet my idea were wholli taken up with what i saw on everi side of me and i wink at my own littl as peopl do at their own fault the captain understood my railleri veri well and merrili repli with the old english proverb that he doubt mine ey were bigger than my belli for he did not observ my stomach so good although i had fast all dai and continu in hi mirth protest he would have gladli given a hundr pound to have seen my closet in the eagl s bill and afterward in it fall from so great a height into the sea which would certainli have been a most astonish object worthi to have the descript of it transmit to futur ag and the comparison of phaeton wa so obviou that he could not forbear appli it although i did not much admir the conceit the captain have been at tonquin wa in hi return to england driven north eastward to the latitud of degre and longitud of but meet a trade wind two dai after i came on board him we sail southward a long time and coast new holland kept our cours west south west and then south south west till we doubl the cape of good hope our voyag wa veri prosper but i shall not troubl the reader with a journal of it the captain call in at on or two port and sent in hi long boat for provis and fresh water but i never went out of the ship till we came into the down which wa on the third dai of june about nine month after my escap i offer to leav my good in secur for payment of my freight but the captain protest he would not receiv on farth we took a kind leav of each other and i made him promis he would come to see me at my hous in redriff i hire a hors and guid for five shill which i borrow of the captain as i wa on the road observ the littl of the hous the tree the cattl and the peopl i began to think myself in lilliput i wa afraid of trampl on everi travel i met and often call aloud to have them stand out of the wai so that i had like to have gotten on or two broken head for my impertin when i came to my own hous for which i wa forc to inquir on of the servant open the door i bent down to go in like a goos under a gate for fear of strike my head my wife run out to embrac me but i stoop lower than her knee think she could otherwis never be abl to reach my mouth my daughter kneel to ask my bless but i could not see her till she aros have been so long us to stand with my head and ey erect to abov sixti feet and then i went to take her up with on hand by the waist i look down upon the servant and on or two friend who were in the hous as if thei had been pigmi and i a giant i told my wife she had been too thrifti for i found she had starv herself and her daughter to noth in short i behav myself so unaccount that thei were all of the captain s opinion when he first saw me and conclud i had lost my wit thi i mention as an instanc of the great power of habit and prejudic in a littl time i and my famili and friend came to a right understand but my wife protest i should never go to sea ani more although my evil destini so order that she had not power to hinder me as the reader mai know hereaft in the mean time i here conclud the second part of my unfortun voyag part iii a voyag to laputa balnibarbi luggnagg glubbdubdrib and japan chapter i the author set out on hi third voyag is taken by pirat the malic of a dutchman hi arriv at an island he is receiv into laputa i had not been at home abov ten dai when captain william robinson a cornish man command of the hopewel a stout ship of three hundr ton came to my hous i had formerli been surgeon of anoth ship where he wa master and a fourth part owner in a voyag to the levant he had alwai treat me more like a brother than an inferior offic and hear of my arriv made me a visit as i apprehend onli out of friendship for noth pass more than what is usual after long absenc but repeat hi visit often express hi joi to find i me in good health ask whether i were now settl for life ad that he intend a voyag to the east indi in two month at last he plainli invit me though with some apolog to be surgeon of the ship that i should have anoth surgeon under me besid our two mate that my salari should be doubl to the usual pai and that have experienc my knowledg in sea affair to be at least equal to hi he would enter into ani engag to follow my advic as much as if i had share in the command he said so mani other oblig thing and i knew him to be so honest a man that i could not reject thi propos the thirst i had of see the world notwithstand my past misfortun continu as violent as ever the onli difficulti that remain wa to persuad my wife whose consent howev i at last obtain by the prospect of advantag she propos to her children we set out the th dai of august and arriv at fort st georg the th of april we staid there three week to refresh our crew mani of whom were sick from thenc we went to tonquin where the captain resolv to continu some time becaus mani of the good he intend to bui were not readi nor could he expect to be dispatch in sever month therefor in hope to defrai some of the charg he must be at he bought a sloop load it with sever sort of good wherewith the tonquines usual trade to the neighbour island and put fourteen men on board whereof three were of the countri he appoint me master of the sloop and gave me power to traffic while he transact hi affair at tonquin we had not sail abov three dai when a great storm aris we were driven five dai to the north north east and then to the east after which we had fair weather but still with a pretti strong gale from the west upon the tenth dai we were chase by two pirat who soon overtook us for my sloop wa so deep laden that she sail veri slow neither were we in a condit to defend ourselv we were board about the same time by both the pirat who enter furious at the head of their men but find us all prostrat upon our face for so i gave order thei pinion us with strong rope and set guard upon us went to search the sloop i observ among them a dutchman who seem to be of some author though he wa not command of either ship he knew us by our counten to be englishmen and jabber to us in hi own languag swore we should be ti back to back and thrown into the sea i spoken dutch toler well i told him who we were and beg him in consider of our be christian and protest of neighbour countri in strict allianc that he would move the captain to take some piti on us thi inflam hi rage he repeat hi threaten and turn to hi companion spoke with great vehem in the japanes languag as i suppos often us the word christiano the largest of the two pirat ship wa command by a japanes captain who spoke a littl dutch but veri imperfectli he came up to me and after sever question which i answer in great humil he said we should not die i made the captain a veri low bow and then turn to the dutchman said i wa sorri to find more merci in a heathen than in a brother christian but i had soon reason to repent those foolish word for that malici reprob have often endeavour in vain to persuad both the captain that i might be thrown into the sea which thei would not yield to after the promis made me that i should not die howev prevail so far as to have a punish inflict on me wors in all human appear than death itself my men were sent by an equal divis into both the pirat ship and my sloop new man as to myself it wa determin that i should be set adrift in a small cano with paddl and a sail and four dai provis which last the japanes captain wa so kind to doubl out of hi own store and would permit no man to search me i got down into the cano while the dutchman stand upon the deck load me with all the curs and injuri term hi languag could afford about an hour befor we saw the pirat i had taken an observ and found we were in the latitud of n and longitud of when i wa at some distanc from the pirat i discov by my pocket glass sever island to the south east i set up my sail the wind be fair with a design to reach the nearest of those island which i made a shift to do in about three hour it wa all rocki howev i got mani bird egg and strike fire i kindl some heath and dry sea weed by which i roast my egg i at no other supper be resolv to spare my provis as much as i could i pass the night under the shelter of a rock strew some heath under me and slept pretti well the next dai i sail to anoth island and thenc to a third and fourth sometim us my sail and sometim my paddl but not to troubl the reader with a particular account of my distress let it suffic that on the fifth dai i arriv at the last island in my sight which lai south south east to the former thi island wa at a greater distanc than i expect and i did not reach it in less than five hour i encompass it almost round befor i could find a conveni place to land in which wa a small creek about three time the wide of my cano i found the island to be all rocki onli a littl intermingl with tuft of grass and sweet smell herb i took out my small provis and after have refresh myself i secur the remaind in a cave whereof there were great number i gather plenti of egg upon the rock and got a quantiti of dry sea weed and parch grass which i design to kindl the next dai and roast my egg as well as i could for i had about me my flint steel match and burn glass i lai all night in the cave where i had lodg my provis my bed wa the same dry grass and sea weed which i intend for fuel i slept veri littl for the disquiet of my mind prevail over my weari and kept me awak i consid how imposs it wa to preserv my life in so desol a place and how miser my end must be yet found myself so listless and despond that i had not the heart to rise and befor i could get spirit enough to creep out of my cave the dai wa far advanc i walk awhil among the rock the sky wa perfectli clear and the sun so hot that i wa forc to turn my face from it when all on a sudden it becam obscur as i thought in a manner veri differ from what happen by the interposit of a cloud i turn back and perceiv a vast opaqu bodi between me and the sun move forward toward the island it seem to be about two mile high and hid the sun six or seven minut but i did not observ the air to be much colder or the sky more darken than if i had stood under the shade of a mountain as it approach nearer over the place where i wa it appear to be a firm substanc the bottom flat smooth and shine veri bright from the reflect of the sea below i stood upon a height about two hundr yard from the shore and saw thi vast bodi descend almost to a parallel with me at less than an english mile distanc i took out my pocket perspect and could plainli discov number of peopl move up and down the side of it which appear to be slope but what those peopl where do i wa not abl to distinguish the natur love of life gave me some inward motion of joi and i wa readi to entertain a hope that thi adventur might some wai or other help to deliv me from the desol place and condit i wa in but at the same time the reader can hardli conceiv my astonish to behold an island in the air inhabit by men who were abl as it should seem to rais or sink or put it into progress motion as thei pleas but not be at that time in a disposit to philosophis upon thi phenomenon i rather chose to observ what cours the island would take becaus it seem for awhil to stand still yet soon after it advanc nearer and i could see the side of it encompass with sever gradat of galleri and stair at certain interv to descend from on to the other in the lowest galleri i beheld some peopl fish with long angl rod and other look on i wave my cap for my hat wa long sinc worn out and my handkerchief toward the island and upon it nearer approach i call and shout with the utmost strength of my voic and then look circumspectli i beheld a crowd gather to that side which wa most in my view i found by their point toward me and to each other that thei plainli discov me although thei made no return to my shout but i could see four or five men run in great hast up the stair to the top of the island who then disappear i happen rightli to conjectur that these were sent for order to some person in author upon thi occas the number of peopl increas and in less than half all hour the island wa move and rais in such a manner that the lowest galleri appear in a parallel of less then a hundr yard distanc from the height where i stood i then put myself in the most supplic postur and spoke in the humblest accent but receiv no answer those who stood nearest over against me seem to be person of distinct as i suppos by their habit thei confer earnestli with each other look often upon me at length on of them call out in a clear polit smooth dialect not unlik in sound to the italian and therefor i return an answer in that languag hope at least that the cadenc might be more agreeabl to hi ear although neither of us understood the other yet my mean wa easili known for the peopl saw the distress i wa in thei made sign for me to come down from the rock and go toward the shore which i accordingli did and the fly island be rais to a conveni height the verg directli over me a chain wa let down from the lowest galleri with a seat fasten to the bottom to which i fix myself and wa drawn up by pullei chapter ii the humour and disposit of the laputian describ an account of their learn of the king and hi court the author s recept there the inhabit subject to fear and disquietud an account of the women at my alight i wa surround with a crowd of peopl but those who stood nearest seem to be of better qualiti thei beheld me with all the mark and circumst of wonder neither inde wa i much in their debt have never till then seen a race of mortal so singular in their shape habit and counten their head were all reclin either to the right or the left on of their ey turn inward and the other directli up to the zenith their outward garment were adorn with the figur of sun moon and star interwoven with those of fiddl flute harp trumpet guitar harpsichord and mani other instrument of music unknown to us in europ i observ here and there mani in the habit of servant with a blown bladder fasten like a flail to the end of a stick which thei carri in their hand in each bladder wa a small quantiti of dri pea or littl pebbl as i wa afterward inform with these bladder thei now and then flap the mouth and ear of those who stood near them of which practic i could not then conceiv the mean it seem the mind of these peopl ar so taken up with intens specul that thei neither can speak nor attend to the discours of other without be rous by some extern taction upon the organ of speech and hear for which reason those person who ar abl to afford it alwai keep a flapper the origin is climenol in their famili as on of their domest nor ever walk abroad or make visit without him and the busi of thi offic is when two three or more person ar in compani gentli to strike with hi bladder the mouth of him who is to speak and the right ear of him or them to whom the speaker address himself thi flapper is likewis emploi dilig to attend hi master in hi walk and upon occas to give him a soft flap on hi ey becaus he is alwai so wrap up in cogit that he is in manifest danger of fall down everi precipic and bounc hi head against everi post and in the street of justl other or be justl himself into the kennel it wa necessari to give the reader thi inform without which he would be at the same loss with me to understand the proceed of these peopl as thei conduct me up the stair to the top of the island and from thenc to the royal palac while we were ascend thei forgot sever time what thei were about and left me to myself till their memori were again rous by their flapper for thei appear altogeth unmov by the sight of my foreign habit and counten and by the shout of the vulgar whose thought and mind were more disengag at last we enter the palac and proceed into the chamber of presenc where i saw the king seat on hi throne attend on each side by person of prime qualiti befor the throne wa a larg tabl fill with globe and sphere and mathemat instrument of all kind hi majesti took not the least notic of us although our entranc wa not without suffici nois by the concours of all person belong to the court but he wa then deep in a problem and we attend at least an hour befor he could solv it there stood by him on each side a young page with flap in their hand and when thei saw he wa at leisur on of them gentli struck hi mouth and the other hi right ear at which he startl like on awak on the sudden and look toward me and the compani i wa in recollect the occas of our come whereof he had been inform befor he spoke some word whereupon immedi a young man with a flap came up to my side and flap me gentli on the right ear but i made sign as well as i could that i had no occas for such an instrument which as i afterward found gave hi majesti and the whole court a veri mean opinion of my understand the king as far as i could conjectur ask me sever question and i address myself to him in all the languag i had when it wa found i could neither understand nor be understood i wa conduct by hi order to an apart in hi palac thi princ be distinguish abov all hi predecessor for hi hospit to stranger where two servant were appoint to attend me my dinner wa brought and four person of qualiti whom i rememb to have seen veri near the king s person did me the honour to dine with me we had two cours of three dish each in the first cours there wa a shoulder of mutton cut into an equilater triangl a piec of beef into a rhomboid and a pud into a cycloid the second cours wa two duck truss up in the form of fiddl sausag and pud resembl flute and hautboi and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp the servant cut our bread into cone cylind parallelogram and sever other mathemat figur while we were at dinner i made bold to ask the name of sever thing in their languag and those nobl person by the assist of their flapper delight to give me answer hope to rais my admir of their great abil if i could be brought to convers with them i wa soon abl to call for bread and drink or whatev els i want after dinner my compani withdrew and a person wa sent to me by the king s order attend by a flapper he brought with him pen ink and paper and three or four book give me to understand by sign that he wa sent to teach me the languag we sat togeth four hour in which time i wrote down a great number of word in column with the translat over against them i likewis made a shift to learn sever short sentenc for my tutor would order on of my servant to fetch someth to turn about to make a bow to sit or to stand or walk and the like then i took down the sentenc in write he show me also in on of hi book the figur of the sun moon and star the zodiac the tropic and polar circl togeth with the denomin of mani plain and solid he gave me the name and descript of all the music instrument and the gener term of art in plai on each of them after he had left me i place all my word with their interpret in alphabet order and thu in a few dai by the help of a veri faith memori i got some insight into their languag the word which i interpret the fly or float island is in the origin laputa whereof i could never learn the true etymolog lap in the old obsolet languag signifi high and untuh a governor from which thei sai by corrupt wa deriv laputa from lapuntuh but i do not approv of thi deriv which seem to be a littl strain i ventur to offer to the learn among them a conjectur of my own that laputa wa quasi lap out lap signifi properli the danc of the sunbeam in the sea and out a wing which howev i shall not obtrud but submit to the judici reader those to whom the king had entrust me observ how ill i wa clad order a tailor to come next morn and take measur for a suit of cloth thi oper did hi offic after a differ manner from those of hi trade in europ he first took my altitud by a quadrant and then with a rule and compass describ the dimens and outlin of my whole bodi all which he enter upon paper and in six dai brought my cloth veri ill made and quit out of shape by happen to mistak a figur in the calcul but my comfort wa that i observ such accid veri frequent and littl regard dure my confin for want of cloth and by an indisposit that held me some dai longer i much enlarg my dictionari and when i went next to court wa abl to understand mani thing the king spoke and to return him some kind of answer hi majesti had given order that the island should move north east and by east to the vertic point over lagado the metropoli of the whole kingdom below upon the firm earth it wa about nineti leagu distant and our voyag last four dai and a half i wa not in the least sensibl of the progress motion made in the air by the island on the second morn about eleven o clock the king himself in person attend by hi nobil courtier and offic have prepar all their music instrument plai on them for three hour without intermiss so that i wa quit stun with the nois neither could i possibl guess the mean till my tutor inform me he said that the peopl of their island had their ear adapt to hear the music of the sphere which alwai plai at certain period and the court wa now prepar to bear their part in whatev instrument thei most excel in our journei toward lagado the capit citi hi majesti order that the island should stop over certain town and villag from whenc he might receiv the petit of hi subject and to thi purpos sever packthread were let down with small weight at the bottom on these packthread the peopl strung their petit which mount up directli like the scrap of paper fasten by school boi at the end of the string that hold their kite sometim we receiv wine and victual from below which were drawn up by pullei the knowledg i had in mathemat gave me great assist in acquir their phraseolog which depend much upon that scienc and music and in the latter i wa not unskil their idea ar perpetu convers in line and figur if thei would for exampl prais the beauti of a woman or ani other anim thei describ it by rhomb circl parallelogram ellips and other geometr term or by word of art drawn from music needless here to repeat i observ in the king s kitchen all sort of mathemat and music instrument after the figur of which thei cut up the joint that were serv to hi majesti s tabl their hous ar veri ill built the wall bevil without on right angl in ani apart and thi defect aris from the contempt thei bear to practic geometri which thei despis as vulgar and mechan those instruct thei give be too refin for the intellect of their workmen which occas perpetu mistak and although thei ar dexter enough upon a piec of paper in the manag of the rule the pencil and the divid yet in the common action and behaviour of life i have not seen a more clumsi awkward and unhandi peopl nor so slow and perplex in their concept upon all other subject except those of mathemat and music thei ar veri bad reason and vehement given to opposit unless when thei happen to be of the right opinion which is seldom their case imagin fanci and invent thei ar wholli stranger to nor have ani word in their languag by which those idea can be express the whole compass of their thought and mind be shut up within the two forement scienc most of them and especi those who deal in the astronom part have great faith in judici astrolog although thei ar asham to own it publicli but what i chiefli admir and thought altogeth unaccount wa the strong disposit i observ in them toward new and polit perpetu inquir into public affair give their judgment in matter of state and passion disput everi inch of a parti opinion i have inde observ the same disposit among most of the mathematician i have known in europ although i could never discov the least analog between the two scienc unless those peopl suppos that becaus the smallest circl ha as mani degre as the largest therefor the regul and manag of the world requir no more abil than the handl and turn of a globe but i rather take thi qualiti to spring from a veri common infirm of human natur inclin us to be most curiou and conceit in matter where we have least concern and for which we ar least adapt by studi or natur these peopl ar under continu disquietud never enjoi a minut peac of mind and their disturb proce from caus which veri littl affect the rest of mortal their apprehens aris from sever chang thei dread in the celesti bodi for instanc that the earth by the continu approach of the sun toward it must in cours of time be absorb or swallow up that the face of the sun will by degre be encrust with it own effluvia and give no more light to the world that the earth veri narrowli escap a brush from the tail of the last comet which would have infal reduc it to ash and that the next which thei have calcul for on and thirti year henc will probabl destroi us for if in it perihelion it should approach within a certain degre of the sun as by their calcul thei have reason to dread it will receiv a degre of heat ten thousand time more intens than that of red hot glow iron and in it absenc from the sun carri a blaze tail ten hundr thousand and fourteen mile long through which if the earth should pass at the distanc of on hundr thousand mile from the nucleu or main bodi of the comet it must in it passag be set on fire and reduc to ash that the sun daili spend it rai without ani nutriment to suppli them will at last be wholli consum and annihil which must be attend with the destruct of thi earth and of all the planet that receiv their light from it thei ar so perpetu alarm with the apprehens of these and the like impend danger that thei can neither sleep quietli in their bed nor have ani relish for the common pleasur and amus of life when thei meet an acquaint in the morn the first question is about the sun s health how he look at hi set and rise and what hope thei have to avoid the stroke of the approach comet thi convers thei ar apt to run into with the same temper that boi discov in delight to hear terribl stori of spirit and hobgoblin which thei greedili listen to and dare not go to bed for fear the women of the island have abund of vivac thei contemn their husband and ar exceedingli fond of stranger whereof there is alwai a consider number from the contin below attend at court either upon affair of the sever town and corpor or their own particular occas but ar much despis becaus thei want the same endow among these the ladi choos their gallant but the vexat is that thei act with too much eas and secur for the husband is alwai so rapt in specul that the mistress and lover mai proce to the greatest familiar befor hi face if he be but provid with paper and implement and without hi flapper at hi side the wive and daughter lament their confin to the island although i think it the most delici spot of ground in the world and although thei live here in the greatest plenti and magnific and ar allow to do whatev thei pleas thei long to see the world and take the divers of the metropoli which thei ar not allow to do without a particular licens from the king and thi is not easi to be obtain becaus the peopl of qualiti have found by frequent experi how hard it is to persuad their women to return from below i wa told that a great court ladi who had sever children is marri to the prime minist the richest subject in the kingdom a veri grace person extrem fond of her and live in the finest palac of the island went down to lagado on the pretenc of health there hid herself for sever month till the king sent a warrant to search for her and she wa found in an obscur eat hous all in rag have pawn her cloth to maintain an old deform footman who beat her everi dai and in whose compani she wa taken much against her will and although her husband receiv her with all possibl kind and without the least reproach she soon after contriv to steal down again with all her jewel to the same gallant and ha not been heard of sinc thi mai perhap pass with the reader rather for an european or english stori than for on of a countri so remot but he mai pleas to consid that the capric of womankind ar not limit by ani climat or nation and that thei ar much more uniform than can be easili imagin in about a month s time i had made a toler profici in their languag and wa abl to answer most of the king s question when i had the honour to attend him hi majesti discov not the least curios to inquir into the law govern histori religion or manner of the countri where i had been but confin hi question to the state of mathemat and receiv the account i gave him with great contempt and indiffer though often rous by hi flapper on each side chapter iii a phenomenon solv by modern philosophi and astronomi the laputian great improv in the latter the king s method of suppress insurrect i desir leav of thi princ to see the curios of the island which he wa gracious pleas to grant and order my tutor to attend me i chiefli want to know to what caus in art or in natur it ow it sever motion whereof i will now give a philosoph account to the reader the fly or float island is exactli circular it diamet yard or about four mile and a half and consequ contain ten thousand acr it is three hundr yard thick the bottom or under surfac which appear to those who view it below is on even regular plate of adam shoot up to the height of about two hundr yard abov it lie the sever miner in their usual order and over all is a coat of rich mould ten or twelv feet deep the decliv of the upper surfac from the circumfer to the centr is the natur caus why all the dew and rain which fall upon the island ar convei in small rivulet toward the middl where thei ar empti into four larg basin each of about half a mile in circuit and two hundr yard distant from the centr from these basin the water is continu exhal by the sun in the daytim which effectu prevent their overflow besid as it is in the power of the monarch to rais the island abov the region of cloud and vapour he can prevent the fall of dew and rain whenev he pleas for the highest cloud cannot rise abov two mile as naturalist agre at least thei were never known to do so in that countri at the centr of the island there is a chasm about fifti yard in diamet whenc the astronom descend into a larg dome which is therefor call flandona gagnol or the astronom s cave situat at the depth of a hundr yard beneath the upper surfac of the adam in thi cave ar twenti lamp continu burn which from the reflect of the adam cast a strong light into everi part the place is store with great varieti of sextant quadrant telescop astrolab and other astronom instrument but the greatest curios upon which the fate of the island depend is a loadston of a prodigi size in shape resembl a weaver s shuttl it is in length six yard and in the thickest part at least three yard over thi magnet is sustain by a veri strong axl of adam pass through it middl upon which it plai and is pois so exactli that the weakest hand can turn it it is hoop round with a hollow cylind of adam four feet yard in diamet place horizont and support by eight adamantin feet each six yard high in the middl of the concav side there is a groov twelv inch deep in which the extrem of the axl ar lodg and turn round as there is occas the stone cannot be remov from it place by ani forc becaus the hoop and it feet ar on continu piec with that bodi of adam which constitut the bottom of the island by mean of thi loadston the island is made to rise and fall and move from on place to anoth for with respect to that part of the earth over which the monarch presid the stone is endu at on of it side with an attract power and at the other with a repuls upon place the magnet erect with it attract end toward the earth the island descend but when the repel extrem point downward the island mount directli upward when the posit of the stone is obliqu the motion of the island is so too for in thi magnet the forc alwai act in line parallel to it direct by thi obliqu motion the island is convei to differ part of the monarch s dominion to explain the manner of it progress let a b repres a line drawn across the dominion of balnibarbi let the line c d repres the loadston of which let d be the repel end and c the attract end the island be over c let the stone be place in posit c d with it repel end downward then the island will be driven upward obliqu toward d when it is arriv at d let the stone be turn upon it axl till it attract end point toward e and then the island will be carri obliqu toward e where if the stone be again turn upon it axl till it stand in the posit e f with it repel point downward the island will rise obliqu toward f where by direct the attract end toward g the island mai be carri to g and from g to h by turn the stone so as to make it repel extrem to point directli downward and thu by chang the situat of the stone as often as there is occas the island is made to rise and fall by turn in an obliqu direct and by those altern rise and fall the obliqu be not consider is convei from on part of the dominion to the other but it must be observ that thi island cannot move beyond the extent of the dominion below nor can it rise abov the height of four mile for which the astronom who have written larg system concern the stone assign the follow reason that the magnet virtu doe not extend beyond the distanc of four mile and that the miner which act upon the stone in the bowel of the earth and in the sea about six leagu distant from the shore is not diffus through the whole globe but termin with the limit of the king s dominion and it wa easi from the great advantag of such a superior situat for a princ to bring under hi obedi whatev countri lai within the attract of that magnet when the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon the island stand still for in that case the extrem of it be at equal distanc from the earth act with equal forc the on in draw downward the other in push upward and consequ no motion can ensu thi loadston is under the care of certain astronom who from time to time give it such posit as the monarch direct thei spend the greatest part of their live in observ the celesti bodi which thei do by the assist of glass far excel our in good for although their largest telescop do not exce three feet thei magnifi much more than those of a hundr with us and show the star with greater clear thi advantag ha enabl them to extend their discoveri much further than our astronom in europ for thei have made a catalogu of ten thousand fix star wherea the largest of our do not contain abov on third part of that number thei have likewis discov two lesser star or satellit which revolv about mar whereof the innermost is distant from the centr of the primari planet exactli three of hi diamet and the outermost five the former revolv in the space of ten hour and the latter in twenti on and a half so that the squar of their period time ar veri near in the same proport with the cube of their distanc from the centr of mar which evid show them to be govern by the same law of gravit that influenc the other heavenli bodi thei have observ nineti three differ comet and settl their period with great exact if thi be true and thei affirm it with great confid it is much to be wish that their observ were made public wherebi the theori of comet which at present is veri lame and defect might be brought to the same perfect with other art of astronomi the king would be the most absolut princ in the univers if he could but prevail on a ministri to join with him but these have their estat below on the contin and consid that the offic of a favourit ha a veri uncertain tenur would never consent to the enslav of their countri if ani town should engag in rebellion or mutini fall into violent faction or refus to pai the usual tribut the king ha two method of reduc them to obedi the first and the mildest cours is by keep the island hover over such a town and the land about it wherebi he can depriv them of the benefit of the sun and the rain and consequ afflict the inhabit with dearth and diseas and if the crime deserv it thei ar at the same time pelt from abov with great stone against which thei have no defenc but by creep into cellar or cave while the roof of their hous ar beaten to piec but if thei still continu obstin or offer to rais insurrect he proce to the last remedi by let the island drop directli upon their head which make a univers destruct both of hous and men howev thi is an extrem to which the princ is seldom driven neither inde is he will to put it in execut nor dare hi minist advis him to an action which as it would render them odiou to the peopl so it would be a great damag to their own estat which all lie below for the island is the king s demesn but there is still inde a more weighti reason why the king of thi countri have been alwai avers from execut so terribl an action unless upon the utmost necess for if the town intend to be destroi should have in it ani tall rock as it gener fall out in the larger citi a situat probabl chosen at first with a view to prevent such a catastroph or if it abound in high spire or pillar of stone a sudden fall might endang the bottom or under surfac of the island which although it consist as i have said of on entir adam two hundr yard thick might happen to crack by too great a shock or burst by approach too near the fire from the hous below as the back both of iron and stone will often do in our chimnei of all thi the peopl ar well appris and understand how far to carri their obstinaci where their liberti or properti is concern and the king when he is highest provok and most determin to press a citi to rubbish order the island to descend with great gentl out of a pretenc of tender to hi peopl but inde for fear of break the adamantin bottom in which case it is the opinion of all their philosoph that the loadston could no longer hold it up and the whole mass would fall to the ground by a fundament law of thi realm neither the king nor either of hi two eldest son ar permit to leav the island nor the queen till she is past child bear chapter iv the author leav laputa is convei to balnibarbi arriv at the metropoli a descript of the metropoli and the countri adjoin the author hospit receiv by a great lord hi convers with that lord although i cannot sai that i wa ill treat in thi island yet i must confess i thought myself too much neglect not without some degre of contempt for neither princ nor peopl appear to be curiou in ani part of knowledg except mathemat and music wherein i wa far their inferior and upon that account veri littl regard on the other side after have seen all the curios of the island i wa veri desir to leav it be heartili weari of those peopl thei were inde excel in two scienc for which i have great esteem and wherein i am not unvers but at the same time so abstract and involv in specul that i never met with such disagre companion i convers onli with women tradesmen flapper and court page dure two month of my abod there by which at last i render myself extrem contempt yet these were the onli peopl from whom i could ever receiv a reason answer i had obtain by hard studi a good degre of knowledg in their languag i wa weari of be confin to an island where i receiv so littl counten and resolv to leav it with the first opportun there wa a great lord at court nearli relat to the king and for that reason alon us with respect he wa univers reckon the most ignor and stupid person among them he had perform mani emin servic for the crown had great natur and acquir part adorn with integr and honour but so ill an ear for music that hi detractor report he had been often known to beat time in the wrong place neither could hi tutor without extrem difficulti teach him to demonstr the most easi proposit in the mathemat he wa pleas to show me mani mark of favour often did me the honour of a visit desir to be inform in the affair of europ the law and custom the manner and learn of the sever countri where i had travel he listen to me with great attent and made veri wise observ on all i spoke he had two flapper attend him for state but never made us of them except at court and in visit of ceremoni and would alwai command them to withdraw when we were alon togeth i entreat thi illustri person to interced in my behalf with hi majesti for leav to depart which he accordingli did as he wa pleas to tell me with regret for inde he had made me sever offer veri advantag which howev i refus with express of the highest acknowledg on the th of februari i took leav of hi majesti and the court the king made me a present to the valu of about two hundr pound english and my protector hi kinsman as much more togeth with a letter of recommend to a friend of hi in lagado the metropoli the island be then hover over a mountain about two mile from it i wa let down from the lowest galleri in the same manner as i had been taken up the contin as far as it is subject to the monarch of the fly island pass under the gener name of balnibarbi and the metropoli as i said befor is call lagado i felt some littl satisfact in find myself on firm ground i walk to the citi without ani concern be clad like on of the nativ and suffici instruct to convers with them i soon found out the person s hous to whom i wa recommend present my letter from hi friend the grande in the island and wa receiv with much kind thi great lord whose name wa munodi order me an apart in hi own hous where i continu dure my stai and wa entertain in a most hospit manner the next morn after my arriv he took me in hi chariot to see the town which is about half the big of london but the hous veri strang built and most of them out of repair the peopl in the street walk fast look wild their ey fix and were gener in rag we pass through on of the town gate and went about three mile into the countri where i saw mani labour work with sever sort of tool in the ground but wa not abl to conjectur what thei were about neither did observ ani expect either of corn or grass although the soil appear to be excel i could not forbear admir at these odd appear both in town and countri and i made bold to desir my conductor that he would be pleas to explain to me what could be meant by so mani busi head hand and face both in the street and the field becaus i did not discov ani good effect thei produc but on the contrari i never knew a soil so unhappili cultiv hous so ill contriv and so ruinou or a peopl whose counten and habit express so much miseri and want thi lord munodi wa a person of the first rank and had been some year governor of lagado but by a cabal of minist wa discharg for insuffici howev the king treat him with tender as a well mean man but of a low contempt understand when i gave that free censur of the countri and it inhabit he made no further answer than by tell me that i had not been long enough among them to form a judgment and that the differ nation of the world had differ custom with other common topic to the same purpos but when we return to hi palac he ask me how i like the build what absurd i observ and what quarrel i had with the dress or look of hi domest thi he might safe do becaus everi thing about him wa magnific regular and polit i answer that hi excel s prudenc qualiti and fortun had exempt him from those defect which folli and beggari had produc in other he said if i would go with him to hi countri hous about twenti mile distant where hi estat lai there would be more leisur for thi kind of convers i told hi excel that i wa entir at hi dispos and accordingli we set out next morn dure our journei he made me observ the sever method us by farmer in manag their land which to me were wholli unaccount for except in some veri few place i could not discov on ear of corn or blade of grass but in three hour travel the scene wa wholli alter we came into a most beauti countri farmer hous at small distanc neatli built the field enclos contain vineyard corn ground and meadow neither do i rememb to have seen a more delight prospect hi excel observ my counten to clear up he told me with a sigh that there hi estat began and would continu the same till we should come to hi hous that hi countrymen ridicul and despis him for manag hi affair no better and for set so ill an exampl to the kingdom which howev wa follow by veri few such as were old and wil and weak like himself we came at length to the hous which wa inde a nobl structur built accord to the best rule of ancient architectur the fountain garden walk avenu and grove were all dispos with exact judgment and tast i gave due prais to everi thing i saw whereof hi excel took not the least notic till after supper when there be no third companion he told me with a veri melancholi air that he doubt he must throw down hi hous in town and countri to rebuild them after the present mode destroi all hi plantat and cast other into such a form as modern usag requir and give the same direct to all hi tenant unless he would submit to incur the censur of pride singular affect ignor capric and perhap increas hi majesti s displeasur that the admir i appear to be under would ceas or diminish when he had inform me of some particular which probabl i never heard of at court the peopl there be too much taken up in their own specul to have regard to what pass here below the sum of hi discours wa to thi effect that about forti year ago certain person went up to laputa either upon busi or divers and after five month continu came back with a veri littl smatter in mathemat but full of volatil spirit acquir in that airi region that these person upon their return began to dislik the manag of everi thing below and fell into scheme of put all art scienc languag and mechan upon a new foot to thi end thei procur a royal patent for erect an academi of projector in lagado and the humour prevail so strongli among the peopl that there is not a town of ani consequ in the kingdom without such an academi in these colleg the professor contriv new rule and method of agricultur and build and new instrument and tool for all trade and manufactur wherebi as thei undertak on man shall do the work of ten a palac mai be built in a week of materi so durabl as to last for ever without repair all the fruit of the earth shall come to matur at whatev season we think fit to choos and increas a hundr fold more than thei do at present with innumer other happi propos the onli inconveni is that none of these project ar yet brought to perfect and in the mean time the whole countri li miser wast the hous in ruin and the peopl without food or cloth by all which instead of be discourag thei ar fifti time more violent bent upon prosecut their scheme driven equal on by hope and despair that as for himself be not of an enterpris spirit he wa content to go on in the old form to live in the hous hi ancestor had built and act as thei did in everi part of life without innov that some few other person of qualiti and gentri had done the same but were look on with an ey of contempt and ill will as enemi to art ignor and ill common wealth s men prefer their own eas and sloth befor the gener improv of their countri hi lordship ad that he would not by ani further particular prevent the pleasur i should certainli take in view the grand academi whither he wa resolv i should go he onli desir me to observ a ruin build upon the side of a mountain about three mile distant of which he gave me thi account that he had a veri conveni mill within half a mile of hi hous turn by a current from a larg river and suffici for hi own famili as well as a great number of hi tenant that about seven year ago a club of those projector came to him with propos to destroi thi mill and build anoth on the side of that mountain on the long ridg whereof a long canal must be cut for a repositori of water to be convei up by pipe and engin to suppli the mill becaus the wind and air upon a height agit the water and therebi made it fitter for motion and becaus the water descend down a decliv would turn the mill with half the current of a river whose cours is more upon a level he said that be then not veri well with the court and press by mani of hi friend he compli with the propos and after emploi a hundr men for two year the work miscarri the projector went off lai the blame entir upon him rail at him ever sinc and put other upon the same experi with equal assur of success as well as equal disappoint in a few dai we came back to town and hi excel consid the bad charact he had in the academi would not go with me himself but recommend me to a friend of hi to bear me compani thither my lord wa pleas to repres me as a great admir of project and a person of much curios and easi belief which inde wa not without truth for i had myself been a sort of projector in my younger dai chapter v the author permit to see the grand academi of lagado the academi larg describ the art wherein the professor emploi themselv thi academi is not an entir singl build but a continu of sever hous on both side of a street which grow wast wa purchas and appli to that us i wa receiv veri kindli by the warden and went for mani dai to the academi everi room ha in it on or more projector and i believ i could not be in fewer than five hundr room the first man i saw wa of a meagr aspect with sooti hand

their master taught them to distinguish by feel and smell it wa inde my misfortun to find them at that time not veri perfect in their lesson and the professor himself happen to be gener mistaken thi artist is much encourag and esteem by the whole fratern in anoth apart i wa highli pleas with a projector who had found a devic of plough the ground with hog to save the charg of plough cattl and labour the method is thi in an acr of ground you buri at six inch distanc and eight deep a quantiti of acorn date chestnut and other mast or veget whereof these anim ar fondest then you drive six hundr or more of them into the field where in a few dai thei will root up the whole ground in search of their food and make it fit for sow at the same time manur it with their dung it is true upon experi thei found the charg and troubl veri great and thei had littl or no crop howev it is not doubt that thi invent mai be capabl of great improv i went into anoth room where the wall and ceil were all hung round with cobweb except a narrow passag for the artist to go in and out at my entranc he call aloud to me not to disturb hi web he lament the fatal mistak the world had been so long in of us silkworm while we had such plenti of domest insect who infinit excel the former becaus thei understood how to weav as well as spin and he propos further that by emploi spider the charg of dye silk should be wholli save whereof i wa fulli convinc when he show me a vast number of fli most beautifulli colour wherewith he fed hi spider assur us that the web would take a tinctur from them and as he had them of all hue he hope to fit everybodi s fanci as soon as he could find proper food for the fli of certain gum oil and other glutin matter to give a strength and consist to the thread there wa an astronom who had undertaken to place a sun dial upon the great weathercock on the town hous by adjust the annual and diurnal motion of the earth and sun so as to answer and coincid with all

same instrument he had a larg pair of bellow with a long slender muzzl of ivori thi he convei eight inch up the anu and draw in the wind he affirm he could make the gut as lank as a dri bladder but when the diseas wa more stubborn and violent he let in the muzzl while the bellow were full of wind which he discharg into the bodi of the patient then withdrew the instrument to replenish it clap hi thumb strongli against the orific of then fundament and thi be repeat three or four time the adventiti wind would rush out bring the noxiou along with it like water put into a pump and the patient recov i saw him try both experi upon a dog but could not discern ani effect from the former after the latter the anim wa readi to burst and made so violent a discharg as wa veri offens to me and my companion the dog di on the spot and we left the doctor endeavour to recov him by the same oper i visit mani other apart but shall not troubl my reader with all the curios i observ be studiou of breviti i had hitherto seen onli on side of the academi the other be appropri to the advanc of specul learn of whom i shall sai someth when i have mention on illustri person more who is call among them the univers artist he told us he had been thirti year emploi hi thought for the improv of human life he had two larg room full of wonder curios and fifti men at work some were condens air into a dry tangibl substanc by extract the nitr and let the aqueou or fluid particl percol other soften marbl for pillow and pin cushion other petrifi the hoof of a live hors to preserv them from founder the artist himself wa at that time busi upon two great design the first to sow land with chaff wherein he affirm the true semin virtu to be contain as he demonstr by sever experi which i wa not skil enough to comprehend the other wa by a certain composit of gum miner and veget outwardli appli to prevent the growth of wool upon two young lamb and he hope in a reason time to propag the breed of nake sheep all over the kingdom we cross a walk to the other part of the academi where as i have alreadi said the projector in specul learn resid the first professor i saw wa in a veri larg room with forti pupil about him after salut observ me to look earnestli upon a frame which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of the room he said perhap i might wonder to see him emploi in a project for improv specul knowledg by practic and mechan oper but the world would soon be sensibl of it us and he flatter himself that a more nobl exalt thought never sprang in ani other man s head everi on knew how labori the usual method is of attain to art and scienc wherea by hi contriv the most ignor person at a reason charg and with a littl bodili labour might write book in philosophi poetri polit law mathemat and theologi without the least assist from geniu or studi he then led me to the frame about the side whereof all hi pupil stood in rank it wa twenti feet squar place in the middl of the room the superfic wa compos of sever bit of wood about the big of a die but some larger than other thei were all link togeth by slender wire these bit of wood were cover on everi squar with paper past on them and on these paper were written all the word of their languag in their sever mood tens and declens but without ani order the professor then desir me to observ for he wa go to set hi engin at work the pupil at hi command took each of them hold of an iron handl whereof there were forti fix round the edg of the frame and give them a sudden turn the whole disposit of the word wa entir chang he then command six and thirti of the lad to read the sever line softli as thei appear upon the frame and where thei found three or four word togeth that might make part of a sentenc thei dictat to the four remain boi who were scribe thi work wa repeat three or four time and at everi turn the engin wa so contriv that the word shift into new place as the squar bit of wood move upsid down pictur the frame six hour a dai the young student were emploi in thi labour and the professor show me sever volum in larg folio alreadi collect of broken sentenc which he intend to piec togeth and out of those rich materi to give the world a complet bodi of all art and scienc which howev might be still improv and much expedit if the public would rais a fund for make and emploi five hundr such frame in lagado and oblig the manag to contribut in common their sever collect he assur me that thi invent had emploi all hi thought from hi youth that he had empti the whole vocabulari into hi frame and made the strictest comput of the gener proport there is in book between the number of particl noun and verb and other part of speech i made my humblest acknowledg to thi illustri person for hi great commun and promis if ever i had the good fortun to return to my nativ countri that i would do him justic as the sole inventor of thi wonder machin the form and contriv of which i desir leav to delin on paper as in the figur here annex i told him although it were the custom of our learn in europ to steal invent from each other who had therebi at least thi advantag that it becam a controversi which wa the right owner yet i would take such caution that he should have the honour entir without a rival we next went to the school of languag where three professor sat in consult upon improv that of their own countri the first project wa to shorten discours by cut polysyl into on and leav out verb and participl becaus in realiti all thing imagin ar but norm the other project wa a scheme for entir abolish all word whatsoev and thi wa urg as a great advantag in point of health as well as breviti for it is plain that everi word we speak is in some degre a diminut of our lung by corros and consequ contribut to the shorten of our live an expedi wa therefor offer that sinc word ar onli name for thing it would be more conveni for all men to carri about them such thing as were necessari to express a particular busi thei ar to discours on and thi invent would certainli have taken place to the great eas as well as health of the subject if the women in conjunct with the vulgar and illiter had not threaten to rais a rebellion unless thei might be allow the liberti to speak with their tongu after the manner of their forefath such constant irreconcil enemi to scienc ar the common peopl howev mani of the most learn and wise adher to the new scheme of express themselv by thing which ha onli thi inconveni attend it that if a man s busi be veri great and of variou kind he must be oblig in proport to carri a greater bundl of thing upon hi back unless he can afford on or two strong servant to attend him i have often beheld two of those sage almost sink under the weight of their pack like pedlar among us who when thei met in the street would lai down their load open their sack and hold convers for an hour togeth then put up their implement help each other to resum their burden and take their leav but for short convers a man mai carri implement in hi pocket and under hi arm enough to suppli him and in hi hous he cannot be at a loss therefor the room where compani meet who practis thi art is full of all thing readi at hand requisit to furnish matter for thi kind of artifici convers anoth great advantag propos by thi invent wa that it would serv as a univers languag to be understood in all civilis nation whose good and utensil ar gener of the same kind or nearli resembl so that their us might easili be comprehend and thu ambassador would be qualifi to treat with foreign princ or minist of state to whose tongu thei were utter stranger i wa at the mathemat school where the master taught hi pupil after a method scarc imagin to us in europ the proposit and demonstr were fairli written on a thin wafer with ink compos of a cephal tinctur thi the student wa to swallow upon a fast stomach and for three dai follow eat noth but bread and water as the wafer digest the tinctur mount to hi brain bear the proposit along with it but the success ha not hitherto been answer partli by some error in the quantum or composit and partli by the pervers of lad to whom thi bolu is so nauseou that thei gener steal asid and discharg it upward befor it can oper neither have thei been yet persuad to us so long an abstin as the prescript requir chapter vi a further account of the academi the author propos some improv which ar honour receiv in the school of polit projector i wa but ill entertain the professor appear in my judgment wholli out of their sens which is a scene that never fail to make me melancholi these unhappi peopl were propos scheme for persuad monarch to choos favourit upon the score of their wisdom capac and virtu of teach minist to consult the public good of reward merit great abil emin servic of instruct princ to know their true interest by place it on the same foundat with that of their peopl of choos for employ person qualifi to exercis them with mani other wild imposs chimera that never enter befor into the heart of man to conceiv and confirm in me the old observ that there is noth so extravag and irrat which some philosoph have not maintain for truth but howev i shall so far do justic to thi part of the academi as to acknowledg that all of them were not so visionari there wa a most ingeni doctor who seem to be perfectli vers in the whole natur and system of govern thi illustri person had veri usefulli emploi hi studi in find out effectu remedi for all diseas and corrupt to which the sever kind of public administr ar subject by the vice or infirm of those who govern as well as by the licenti of those who ar to obei for instanc wherea all writer and reason have agre that there is a strict univers resembl between the natur and the polit bodi can there be ani thing more evid than that the health of both must be preserv and the diseas cure by the same prescript it is allow that senat and great council ar often troubl with redund ebulli and other peccant humour with mani diseas of the head and more of the heart with strong convuls with grievou contract of the nerv and sinew in both hand but especi the right with spleen flatu vertigo and delirium with scroful tumour full of fetid purul matter with sour frothi ructat with canin appetit and crude of digest besid mani other needless to mention thi doctor therefor propos that upon the meet of the senat certain physician should attend it the three first dai of their sit and at the close of each dai s debat feel the puls of everi senat after which have matur consid and consult upon the natur of the sever maladi and the method of cure thei should on the fourth dai return to the senat hous attend by their apothecari store with proper medicin and befor the member sat administ to each of them lenit aperit absters corros restring palli lax cephalalg icter apophlegmat acoust as their sever case requir and accord as these medicin should oper repeat alter or omit them at the next meet thi project could not be of ani great expens to the public and might in my poor opinion be of much us for the despatch of busi in those countri where senat have ani share in the legisl power beget unanim shorten debat open a few mouth which ar now close and close mani more which ar now open curb the petul of the young and correct the posit of the old rous the stupid and damp the pert again becaus it is a gener complaint that the favourit of princ ar troubl with short and weak memori the same doctor propos that whoever attend a first minist after have told hi busi with the utmost breviti and in the plainest word should at hi departur give the said minist a tweak by the nose or a kick in the belli or tread on hi corn or lug him thrice by both ear or run a pin into hi breech or pinch hi arm black and blue to prevent forget and at everi leve dai repeat the same oper till the busi were done or absolut refus he likewis direct that everi senat in the great council of a nation after he had deliv hi opinion and argu in the defenc of it should be oblig to give hi vote directli contrari becaus if that were done the result would infal termin in the good of the public when parti in a state ar violent he offer a wonder contriv to reconcil them the method is thi you take a hundr leader of each parti you dispos them into coupl of such whose head ar nearest of a size then let two nice oper saw off the occiput of each coupl at the same time in such a manner that the brain mai be equal divid let the occiput thu cut off be interchang appli each to the head of hi opposit parti man it seem inde to be a work that requir some exact but the professor assur us that if it were dexter perform the cure would be infal for he argu thu that the two half brain be left to debat the matter between themselv within the space of on skull would soon come to a good understand and produc that moder as well as regular of think so much to be wish for in the head of those who imagin thei come into the world onli to watch and govern it motion and as to the differ of brain in quantiti or qualiti among those who ar director in faction the doctor assur us from hi own knowledg that it wa a perfect trifl i heard a veri warm debat between two professor about the most commodi and effectu wai and mean of rais monei without griev the subject the first affirm the justest method would be to lai a certain tax upon vice and folli and the sum fix upon everi man to be rate after the fairest manner by a juri of hi neighbour the second wa of an opinion directli contrari to tax those qualiti of bodi and mind for which men chiefli valu themselv the rate to be more or less accord to the degre of excel the decis whereof should be left entir to their own breast the highest tax wa upon men who ar the greatest favourit of the other sex and the assess accord to the number and natur of the favour thei have receiv for which thei ar allow to be their own voucher wit valour and polit were likewis propos to be larg tax and collect in the same manner by everi person s give hi own word for the quantum of what he possess but as to honour justic wisdom and learn thei should not be tax at all becaus thei ar qualif of so singular a kind that no man will either allow them in hi neighbour or valu them in himself the women were propos to be tax accord to their beauti and skill in dress wherein thei had the same privileg with the men to be determin by their own judgment but constanc chastiti good sens and good natur were not rate becaus thei would not bear the charg of collect to keep senat in the interest of the crown it wa propos that the member should raffl for employ everi man first take an oath and give secur that he would vote for the court whether he won or not after which the loser had in their turn the liberti of raffl upon the next vacanc thu hope and expect would be kept aliv none would complain of broken

mention of me in hi treatis i saw noth in thi countri that could invit me to a longer continu and began to think of return home to england chapter vii the author leav lagado arriv at maldonada no ship readi he take a short voyag to glubbdubdrib hi recept by the governor the contin of which thi kingdom is apart extend itself as i have reason to believ eastward to that unknown tract of america westward of california and north to the pacif ocean which is not abov a hundr and fifti mile from lagado where there is a good port and much commerc with the great island of luggnagg situat to the north west about degre north latitud and longitud thi island of luggnagg stand south eastward of japan about a hundr leagu distant there is a strict allianc between the japanes emperor and the king of luggnagg which afford frequent opportun of sail from on island to the other i determin therefor to direct my cours thi wai in order to my return to europ i hire two mule with a guid to show me the wai and carri my small baggag i took leav of my nobl protector who had shown me so much favour and made me a gener present at my departur my journei wa without ani accid or adventur worth relat when i arriv at the port of maldonada for so it is call there wa no ship in the harbour bound for luggnagg nor like to be in some time the town is about as larg as portsmouth i soon fell into some acquaint and wa veri hospit receiv a gentleman of distinct said to me that sinc the ship bound for luggnagg could not be readi in less than a month it might be no disagre amus for me to take a trip to the littl island of glubbdubdrib about five leagu off to the south west he offer himself and a friend to accompani me and that i should be provid with a small conveni bark for the voyag glubbdubdrib as nearli as i can interpret the word signifi the island of sorcer or magician it is about on third as larg as the isl of wight and extrem fruit it is govern by the head of a certain tribe who ar all magician thi tribe marri onli among each other and the eldest in success is princ or governor he ha a nobl palac and a park of about three thousand acr surround by a wall of hewn stone twenti feet high in thi park ar sever small enclosur for cattl corn and garden the governor and hi famili ar serv and attend by domest of a kind somewhat unusu by hi skill in necrom he ha a power of call whom he pleas from the dead and command their servic for twenti four hour but no longer nor can he call the same person up again in less than three month except upon veri extraordinari occas when we arriv at the island which wa about eleven in the morn on of the gentlemen who accompani me went to the governor and desir admitt for a stranger who came on purpos to have the honour of attend on hi high thi wa immedi grant and we all three enter the gate of the palac between two row of guard arm and dress after a veri antic manner and with someth in their counten that made my flesh creep with a horror i cannot express we pass through sever apart between servant of the same sort rank on each side as befor till we came to the chamber of presenc where after three profound obeis and a few gener question we were permit to sit on three stool near the lowest step of hi high s throne he understood the languag of balnibarbi although it wa differ from that of thi island he desir me to give him some account of my travel and to let me see that i should be treat without ceremoni he dismiss all hi attend with a turn of hi finger at which to my great astonish thei vanish in an instant like vision in a dream when we awak on a sudden i could not recov myself in some time till the governor assur me that i should receiv no hurt and observ my two companion to be under no concern who had been often entertain in the same manner i began to take courag and relat to hi high a short histori of my sever adventur yet not without some hesit and frequent look behind me to the place where i had seen those domest spectr i had the honour to dine with the governor where a new set of ghost serv up the meat and wait at tabl i now observ myself to be less terrifi than i had been in the morn i stai till sunset but humbl desir hi high to excus me for not accept hi invit of lodg in the palac my two friend and i lai at a privat hous in the town adjoin which is the capit of thi littl island and the next morn we return to pai our duti to the governor as he wa pleas to command us after thi manner we continu in the island for ten dai most part of everi dai with the governor and at night in our lodg i soon grew so familiar to the sight of spirit that after the third or fourth time thei gave me no emot at all or if i had ani apprehens left my curios prevail over them for hi high the governor order me to call up whatev person i would choos to name and in whatev number among all the dead from the begin of the world to the present time and command them to answer ani question i should think fit to ask with thi condit that my question must be confin within the compass of the time thei live in and on thing i might depend upon that thei would certainli tell me the truth for ly wa a talent of no us in the lower world i made my humbl acknowledg to hi high for so great a favour we were in a chamber from whenc there wa a fair prospect into the park and becaus my first inclin wa to be entertain with scene of pomp and magnific i desir to see alexand the great at the head of hi armi just after the battl of arbela which upon a motion of the governor s finger immedi appear in a larg field under the window where we stood alexand wa call up into the room it wa with great difficulti that i understood hi greek and had but littl of my own he assur me upon hi honour that he wa not poison but di of a bad fever by excess drink next i saw hannib pass the alp who told me he had not a drop of vinegar in hi camp i saw cesar and pompei at the head of their troop just readi to engag i saw the former in hi last great triumph i desir that the senat of rome might appear befor me in on larg chamber and an assembl of somewhat a later ag in counterview in anoth the first seem to be an assembl of hero and demigod the other a knot of pedlar pick pocket highwayman and bulli the governor at my request gave the sign for cesar and brutu to advanc toward us i wa struck with a profound vener at the sight of brutu and could easili discov the most consumm virtu the greatest intrepid and firm of mind the truest love of hi countri and gener benevol for mankind in everi lineament of hi counten i observ with much pleasur that these two person were in good intellig with each other and cesar freeli confess to me that the greatest action of hi own life were not equal by mani degre to the glori of take it awai i had the honour to have much convers with brutu and wa told that hi ancestor juniu socrat epaminonda cato the younger sir thoma more and himself were perpetu togeth a sextumvir to which all the ag of the world cannot add a seventh it would be tediou to troubl the reader with relat what vast number of illustri person were call up to gratifi that insati desir i had to see the world in everi period of antiqu place befor me i chiefli fed mine ey with behold the destroy of tyrant and usurp and the restor of liberti to oppress and injur nation but it is imposs to express the satisfact i receiv in my own mind after such a manner as to make it a suitabl entertain to the reader chapter viii a further account of glubbdubdrib ancient and modern histori correct have a desir to see those ancient who were most renown for wit and learn i set apart on dai on purpos i propos that homer and aristotl might appear at the head of all their comment but these were so numer that some hundr were forc to attend in the court and outward room of the palac i knew and could distinguish those two hero at first sight not onli from the crowd but from each other homer wa the taller and comeli person of the two walk veri erect for on of hi ag and hi ey were the most quick and pierc i ever beheld aristotl stoop much and made us of a staff hi visag wa meagr hi hair lank and thin and hi voic hollow i soon discov that both of them were perfect stranger to the rest of the compani and had never seen or heard of them befor and i had a whisper from a ghost who shall be nameless that these comment alwai kept in the most distant quarter from their princip in the lower world through a conscious of shame and guilt becaus thei had so horribl misrepres the mean of those author to poster i introduc didymu and eustathiu to homer and prevail on him to treat them better than perhap thei deserv for he soon found thei want a geniu to enter into the spirit of a poet but aristotl wa out of all patienc with the account i gave him of scotu and ramu as i present them to him and he ask them whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunc as themselv i then desir the governor to call up descart and gassendi with whom i prevail to explain their system to aristotl thi great philosoph freeli acknowledg hi own mistak in natur philosophi becaus he proceed in mani thing upon conjectur as all men must do and he found that gassendi who had made the doctrin of epicuru as palat as he could and the vortic of descart were equal to be explod he predict the same fate to attract whereof the present learn ar such zealou assert he said that new system of natur were but new fashion which would vari in everi ag and even those who pretend to demonstr them from mathemat principl would flourish but a short period of time and be out of vogu when that wa determin i spent five dai in convers with mani other of the ancient learn i saw most of the first roman emperor i prevail on the governor to call up heliogabalu s cook to dress us a dinner but thei could not show us much of their skill for want of materi a helot of agesilau made us a dish of spartan broth but i wa not abl to get down a second spoon the two gentlemen who conduct me to the island were press by their privat affair to return in three dai which i emploi in see some of the modern dead who had made the greatest figur for two or three hundr year past in our own and other countri of europ and have been alwai a great admir of old illustri famili i desir the governor would call up a dozen or two of king with their ancestor in order for eight or nine gener but my disappoint wa grievou and unexpect for instead of a long train with royal diadem i saw in on famili two fiddler three spruce courtier and an italian prelat in anoth a barber an abbot and two cardin i have too great a vener for crown head to dwell ani longer on so nice a subject but as to count marquis duke earl and the like i wa not so scrupul and i confess it wa not without some pleasur that i found myself abl to trace the particular featur by which certain famili ar distinguish up to their origin i could plainli discov whenc on famili deriv a long chin why a second ha abound with knave for two gener and fool for two more why a third happen to be crack brain and a fourth to be sharper whenc it came what polydor virgil sai of a certain great hous nec vir forti nec foemina casta how cruelti falsehood and cowardic grew to be characterist by which certain famili ar distinguish as much as by their coat of arm who first brought the pox into a nobl hous which ha lineal descend scroful tumour to their poster neither could i wonder at all thi when i saw such an interrupt of lineag by page lackei valet coachmen gamest fiddler player captain and pickpocket i wa chiefli disgust with modern histori for have strictli examin all the person of greatest name in the court of princ for a hundr year past i found how the world had been misl by prostitut writer to ascrib the greatest exploit in war to coward the wisest counsel to fool sincer to flatter roman virtu to betray of their countri pieti to atheist chastiti to sodomit truth to inform how mani innoc and excel person had been condemn to death or banish by the practis of great minist upon the corrupt of judg and the malic of faction how mani villain had been exalt to the highest place of trust power digniti and profit how great a share in the motion and event of court council and senat might be challeng by bawd whore pimp parasit and buffoon how low an opinion i had of human wisdom and integr when i wa truli inform of the spring and motiv of great enterpris and revolut in the world and of the contempt accid to which thei ow their success here i discov the rogueri and ignor of those who pretend to write anecdot or secret histori who send so mani king to their grave with a cup of poison will repeat the discours between a princ and chief minist where no wit wa by unlock the thought and cabinet of ambassador and secretari of state and have the perpetu misfortun to be mistaken here i discov the true caus of mani great event that have surpris the world how a whore can govern the back stair the back stair a council and the council a senat a gener confess in my presenc that he got a victori pure by the forc of cowardic and ill conduct and an admir that for want of proper intellig he beat the enemi to whom he intend to betrai the fleet three king protest to me that in their whole reign thei never did onc prefer ani person of merit unless by mistak or treacheri of some minist in whom thei confid neither would thei do it if thei were to live again and thei show with great strength of reason that the royal throne could not be support without corrupt becaus that posit confid restiff temper which virtu infus into a man wa a perpetu clog to public busi i had the curios to inquir in a particular manner by what method great number had procur to

could not have easili overlook it and it wa imposs that hi majesti a most judici princ should not provid himself with a good number of such wise and abl counsellor yet perhap the virtu of those reverend sage wa too strict for the corrupt and libertin manner of a court and we often find by experi that young men ar too opinion and volatil to be guid by the sober dictat of their senior howev sinc the king wa pleas to allow me access to hi royal person i wa resolv upon the veri first occas to deliv my opinion to him on thi matter freeli and at larg by the help of my interpret and whether he would pleas to take my advic or not yet in on thing i wa determin that hi majesti have frequent offer me an establish in thi countri i would with great thank accept the favour and pass my life here in the convers of those superior be the struldbrug if thei would pleas to admit me the gentleman to whom i address my discours becaus as i have alreadi observ he spoke the languag of balnibarbi said to me with a sort of a smile which usual aris from piti to the ignor that he wa glad of ani occas to keep me among them and desir my permiss to explain to the compani what i had spoke he did so and thei talk togeth for some time in their own languag whereof i understood not a syllabl neither could i observ by their counten what impress my discours had made on them after a short silenc the same

mistak which i had fallen into through the common imbecil of human natur and upon that allow wa less answer for them that thi breed of struldbrug wa peculiar to their countri for there were no such peopl either in balnibarbi or japan where he had the honour to be ambassador from hi majesti and found the nativ in both those kingdom veri hard to believ that the fact wa possibl and it appear from my astonish when he first mention the matter to me that i receiv it as a thing wholli new and scarc to be credit that in the two kingdom abov mention where dure hi resid he had convers veri much he observ long life to be the univers desir and wish of mankind that whoever had on foot in the grave wa sure to hold back the other as strongli as he could that the oldest had still hope of live on dai longer and look on death as the greatest evil from which natur alwai prompt him to retreat onli in thi island of luggnagg the appetit for live wa not so eager from the continu exampl of the struldbrug befor their ey that the system of live contriv by me wa unreason and unjust becaus it suppos a perpetu of youth health and vigour which no man could be so foolish to hope howev extravag he mai be in hi wish that the question therefor wa not whether a man would choos to be alwai in the prime of youth attend with prosper and health but how he would pass a perpetu life under all the usual disadvantag which old ag bring along with it for although few men will avow their desir of be immort upon such hard condit yet in the two kingdom befor mention of balnibarbi and japan he observ that everi man desir to put off death some time longer let it approach ever so late and he rare heard of ani man who di willingli except he were incit by the extrem of grief or tortur and he appeal to me whether in those countri i had travel as well as my own i had not observ the same gener disposit after thi prefac he gave me a particular account of the struldbrug among them he said thei commonli act like mortal till about thirti year old after which by degre thei grew melancholi and deject increas in both till thei came to fourscor thi he learn from their own confess for otherwis there not be abov two or three of that speci born in an ag thei were too few to form a gener observ by when thei came to fourscor year which is reckon the extrem of live in thi countri thei had not onli all the folli and infirm of other old men but mani more which aros from the dread prospect of never dy thei were not onli opinion peevish covet moros vain talk but incap of friendship and dead to all natur affect which never descend below their grandchildren envi and impot desir ar their prevail passion but those object against which their envi seem princip direct ar the vice of the younger sort and the death of the old by reflect on the former thei find themselv cut off from all possibl of pleasur and whenev thei see a funer thei lament and repin that other have gone to a harbour of rest to which thei themselv never can hope to arriv thei have no remembr of anyth but what thei learn and observ in their youth and middl ag and even that is veri imperfect and for the truth or particular of ani fact it is safer to depend on common tradit than upon their best recollect the least miser among them appear to be those who turn to dotag and entir lose their memori these meet with more piti and assist becaus thei want mani bad qualiti which abound in other if a struldbrug happen to marri on of hi own kind the marriag is dissolv of cours by the courtesi of the kingdom as soon as the younger of the two come to be fourscor for the law think it a reason indulg that those who ar condemn without ani fault of their own to a perpetu continu in the world should not have their miseri doubl by the load of a wife as soon as thei have complet the term of eighti year thei ar look on as dead in law their heir immedi succe to their estat onli a small pittanc is reserv for their support and the poor on ar maintain at the public charg after that period thei ar held incap of ani employ of trust or profit thei cannot purchas land or take leas neither ar thei allow to be wit in ani caus either civil

diseas thei were subject to still continu without increas or diminish in talk thei forget the common appel of thing and the name of person even of those who ar their nearest friend and relat for the same reason thei never can amus themselv with read becaus their memori will not serv to carri them from the begin of a sentenc to the end and by thi defect thei ar depriv of the onli entertain whereof thei might otherwis be capabl the languag of thi countri be alwai upon the flux the struldbrug of on ag do not understand those of anoth neither ar thei abl after two hundr year to hold ani convers farther than by a few gener word with their neighbour the mortal and thu thei lie under the disadvantag of live like foreign in their own countri thi wa the account given me of the struldbrug as near as i can rememb i afterward saw five or six of differ ag the youngest not abov two hundr year old who were brought to me at sever time by some of my friend but although thei were told that i wa a great travel and had seen all the world thei had not the least curios to ask me a question onli desir i would give them slumskudask or a token of remembr which is a modest wai of beg to avoid the law that strictli forbid it becaus thei ar provid for by the public although inde with a veri scanti allow thei ar despis and hate by all sort of peopl when on of them is born it is reckon omin and their

the usual wai of comput how old thei ar is by ask them what king or great person thei can rememb and then consult histori for infal the last princ in their mind did not begin hi reign after thei were fourscor year old thei were the most mortifi sight i ever beheld and the women more horribl than the men besid the usual deform in extrem old ag thei acquir an addit ghastli in proport to their number of year which is not to be describ and among half a dozen i soon distinguish which wa the eldest although there wa not abov a centuri or two between them the reader will easili believ that from what i had hear and seen my keen appetit for perpetu of life wa much abat i grew heartili asham of the pleas vision i had form and thought no tyrant could invent a death into which i would not run with pleasur from such a life the king heard of all that had pass between me and my friend upon thi occas and ralli me veri pleasantli wish i could send a coupl of struldbrug to my own countri to arm our peopl against the fear of death but thi it seem is forbidden by the fundament law of the kingdom or els i should have been well content with the troubl and expens of transport them i could not but agre that the law of thi kingdom rel to the struldbrug were found upon the strongest reason and such as ani other countri would be under the necess of enact in the like circumst otherwis as avaric is the necessari consequ of old ag those immort would in time becom proprietor of the whole nation and engross the civil power which for want of abil to manag must end in the ruin of the public chapter xi the author leav luggnagg and sail to japan from thenc he return in a dutch ship to amsterdam and from amsterdam to england i thought thi account of the struldbrug might be some entertain to the reader becaus it seem to be a littl out of the common wai at least i do not rememb to have met the like in ani book of travel that ha come to my hand and if i am deceiv my excus must be that it is necessari for travel who describ the same countri veri often to agre in dwell on the same particular without deserv the censur of have borrow or transcrib from those who wrote befor them there is inde a perpetu commerc between thi kingdom and the great empir of japan and it is veri probabl that the japanes author mai have given some account of the struldbrug but my stai in japan wa so short and i wa so entir a stranger to the languag that i wa not qualifi to make ani inquiri but i hope the dutch upon thi notic will be curiou and abl enough to suppli my defect hi majesti have often press me to accept some employ in hi court and find me absolut determin to return to my nativ countri wa pleas to give me hi licens to depart and honour me with a letter of recommend under hi own hand to the emperor of japan he likewis present me with four hundr and forti four larg piec of gold thi nation delight in even number and a red diamond which i sold in england for eleven hundr pound on the th of mai i took a solemn leav of hi majesti and all my friend thi princ wa so graciou as to order a guard to conduct me to glanguenstald which is a royal port to the south west part of the island in six dai i found a vessel readi to carri me to japan and spent fifteen dai in the voyag we land at a small port town call xamoschi situat on the south east part of japan the town li on the western point where there is a narrow strait lead northward into along arm of the sea upon the north west part of which yedo the metropoli stand at land i show the custom hous offic my letter from the king of luggnagg to hi imperi majesti thei knew the seal perfectli well it wa as broad as the palm of my hand the impress wa a king lift up a lame beggar from the earth the magistr of the town hear of my letter receiv me as a public minist thei provid me with carriag and servant and bore my charg to yedo where i wa admit to an audienc and deliv my letter which wa open with great ceremoni and explain to the emperor by an interpret who then gave me notic by hi majesti s order that i should signifi my request and whatev it were it should be grant for the sake of hi royal brother of luggnagg thi interpret wa a person emploi to transact affair with the holland he soon conjectur by my counten that i wa a european and therefor repeat hi majesti s command in low dutch which he spoke perfectli well i answer as i had befor determin that i wa a dutch merchant shipwreck in a veri remot countri whenc i had travel by sea and land to luggnagg and then took ship for japan where i knew my

to thi i ad anoth petit that for the sake of my patron the king of luggnagg hi majesti would condescend to excus my perform the ceremoni impos on my countrymen of trampl upon the crucifix becaus i had been thrown into hi kingdom by my misfortun without ani intent of trade when thi latter petit wa interpret to the emperor he seem a littl surpris and said he believ i wa the first of my countrymen who ever made ani scrupl in thi point and that he began to doubt whether i wa a real holland or not but rather suspect i must be a christian howev for the reason i had offer but chiefli to gratifi the king of luggnagg by an uncommon mark of hi favour he would compli with the singular of my humour but the affair must be manag with dexter and hi offic should be command to let me pass as it were by forget for he assur me that if the secret should be discov by my countrymen the dutch thei would cut my throat in the voyag i return my thank by the interpret for so unusu a favour and some troop be at that time on their march to nangasac the command offic had order to convei me safe thither with particular instruct about the busi of the crucifix on the th dai of june i arriv at nangasac after a

spoke dutch well the seamen soon knew whenc i came last thei were curiou to inquir into my voyag and cours of life i made up a stori as short and probabl as i could but conceal the greatest part i knew mani person in holland i wa abl to invent name for my parent whom i pretend to be obscur peopl in the provinc of gelderland i would have given the captain on theodoru vangrult what he pleas to ask for my voyag to holland but understand i wa a surgeon he wa content to take half the usual rate on condit that i would serv him in the wai of my call befor we took ship i wa often ask by some of the crew whether i had perform the ceremoni abov mention i evad the question by gener answer that i had satisfi the emperor and court in all particular howev a malici rogu of a skipper went to an offic and point to me told him i had not yet trampl on the crucifix but the other who had receiv instruct to let me pass gave the rascal twenti stroke on the shoulder with a bamboo after which i wa no

fear of be overtaken by the tide and so bade me farewel in thi desol condit i advanc forward and soon got upon firm ground where i sat down on a bank to rest myself and consid what i had best do when i wa a littl refresh i went up into the countri resolv to deliv myself to the first savag i should meet and purchas my life from them by some bracelet glass ring and other toi which sailor usual provid themselv with in those voyag and whereof i had some about me the land wa divid by long row of tree not regularli plant but natur grow there wa great plenti of grass and sever field of oat i walk veri circumspectli for fear of be surpris or suddenli shot with an arrow from behind or on either side i fell into a beaten road where i saw mani tract of human feet and some of cow but most of hors at last i beheld sever anim in a field and on or two of the same kind sit in tree their shape wa veri singular and deform which a littl discompos me so that i lai down behind a thicket to observ them better some of them come forward near the place where i lai gave me an opportun of distinctli mark their form their head and breast were cover with a thick hair some frizzl and other lank thei had beard like goat and a long ridg of hair down their back and the fore part of their leg and feet but the rest of their bodi wa bare so that i might see their skin which were of a brown buff colour thei had no tail nor ani hair at all on their buttock except about the anu which i presum natur had place there to defend them as thei sat on the ground for thi postur thei us as well as ly down and often stood on their hind feet thei climb high tree as nimbl as a squirrel for thei had strong extend claw befor and behind termin in sharp point and hook thei would often spring and bound and leap

in all my travel so disagre an anim or on against which i natur conceiv so strong an antipathi so that think i had seen enough full of contempt and avers i got up and pursu the beaten road hope it might direct me to the cabin of some indian i had not got far when i met on of these creatur full in my wai and come up directli to me the ugli monster when he saw me distort sever wai everi featur of hi visag and stare as at an object he had never seen befor then approach nearer lift up hi fore paw whether out of curios or mischief i could not tell but i drew my hanger and gave him a good blow with the flat side of it for i durst not strike with the edg fear the inhabit might be provok against me if thei should come to know that i had kill or maim ani of their cattl when the beast felt the smart he drew back and roar so loud that a herd of at least forti came flock about me from the next field howl and make odiou face but i ran to the bodi of a tree and lean my back against it kept them off by wave my hanger sever of thi curs brood get hold of the branch behind leap up into the tree whenc thei began to discharg their excrement on my head howev i escap pretti well by stick close to the stem of the tree but wa almost stifl with the filth which fell about me on everi side in the midst of thi distress i observ them all to run awai on a sudden as fast as thei could at which i ventur to leav the tree and pursu the road wonder what it wa that could put them into thi fright but look on my left hand i saw a hors walk softli in the field which my persecutor have sooner discov wa the caus of their flight the hors start a littl when he came near me but soon recov himself look full in my face with manifest token of wonder he view my hand and feet walk round me sever time i would have pursu my journei but he place himself directli in the wai yet look with a veri mild aspect never offer the least violenc we stood gaze at each other for some time at last i took the bold to reach my hand toward hi neck with a design to stroke it us the common style and whistl of jockei when thei ar go to handl a strang hors but thi anim seem to receiv my civil with disdain shook hi head and bent hi brow softli rais up hi right fore foot to remov my hand then he neigh three or four time but in so differ a cadenc that i almost began to think he wa speak to himself in some languag of hi own while he and i were thu emploi anoth hors came up who appli himself to the first in a veri formal manner thei gentli struck each other s right hoof befor neigh sever time by turn and vari the sound which seem to be almost articul thei went some pace off as if it were to confer togeth walk side by side backward and forward like person deliber upon some affair of weight but often turn their ey toward me as it were to watch that i might not escap i wa amaz to see such action and behaviour in brute beast and conclud with myself that if the inhabit of thi countri were endu with a proportion degre of reason thei must need be the wisest peopl upon earth thi thought gave me so much comfort that i resolv to go forward until i could discov some hous or villag or meet with ani of the nativ leav the two hors to discours togeth as thei pleas but the first who wa a dappl grai observ me to steal off neigh after me in so express a tone that i fanci myself to understand what he meant whereupon i turn back and came near to him to expect hi farther command but conceal my fear as much as i could for i began to be in some pain how thi adventur might termin and the reader will easili believ i did not much like my present situat the two hors came up close to me look with great earnest upon my face and hand the grai steed rub my hat all round with hi right fore hoof and discompos it so much that i wa forc to adjust it better by take it off and settl it again whereat both he and hi companion who wa a brown bai appear to be much surpris the latter felt the lappet of my coat and find it to hang loos about me thei both look with new sign of wonder he stroke my right hand seem to admir the soft and colour but he squeez it so hard between hi hoof and hi pastern that i wa forc to roar after which thei both touch me with all possibl tender thei were under great perplex about my shoe and stock which thei felt veri often neigh to each other and us variou gestur not unlik those of a philosoph when he would attempt to solv some new and difficult phenomenon upon the whole the behaviour of these anim wa so orderli and ration so acut and judici that i at last conclud thei must need be magician who had thu metamorphos themselv upon some design and see a stranger in the wai resolv to divert themselv with him or perhap were realli amaz at the sight of a man so veri differ in habit featur and complexion from those who might probabl live in so remot a climat upon the strength of thi reason i ventur to address them in the follow manner gentlemen if you be conjur as i have good caus to believ you can understand my languag therefor i make bold to let your worship know that i am a poor distress englishman driven by hi misfortun upon your coast and i entreat on of you to let me ride upon hi back as if he were a real hors to some hous or villag where i can be reliev in return of which favour i will make you a present of thi knife and bracelet take them out of my pocket the two creatur stood silent while i spoke seem to listen with great attent and when i had end thei neigh frequent toward each other as if thei were engag in seriou convers i plainli observ that their languag express the passion veri well and the word might with littl pain be resolv into an alphabet more easili than the chines i could frequent distinguish the word yahoo which wa repeat by each of them sever time and although it wa imposs for me to conjectur what it meant yet while the two hors were busi in convers i endeavour to practis thi word upon my tongu and as soon as thei were silent i boldli pronounc yahoo in a loud voic imit at the same time as near as i could the neigh of a hors at which thei were both visibl surpris and the grai repeat the same word twice as if he meant to teach me the right accent wherein i spoke after him as well as i could and found myself perceiv to improv everi time though veri far from ani degre of perfect then the bai tri me with a second word much harder to be pronounc but reduc it to the english orthographi mai be spelt thu houyhnhnm i did not succe in thi so well as in the former but after two or three farther trial i had better fortun and thei both appear amaz at my capac after some further discours which i then conjectur might relat to me the two friend took their leav with the same compliment of strike each other s hoof and the grai made me sign that i should walk befor him wherein i thought it prudent to compli till i could find a better director when i offer to slacken my pace he would cry hhuun hhuun i guess hi mean and gave him to understand as well as i could that i wa weari and not abl to walk faster upon which he would stand awhil to let me rest chapter ii the author conduct by a houyhnhnm to hi hous the hous describ the author s recept the food of the houyhnhnm the author in distress for want of meat is at last reliev hi manner of feed in thi countri have travel about three mile we came to a long kind of build made of timber stuck in the ground and wattl across the roof wa low and cover with straw i now began to be a littl comfort and took out some toi which travel usual carri for present to the savag indian of america and other part in hope the peopl of the hous would be therebi encourag to receiv me kindli the hors made me a sign to go in first it wa a larg room with a smooth clai floor and a rack and manger extend the whole length on on side there were three nag and two mare not eat but some of them sit down upon their ham which i veri much wonder at but wonder more to see the rest emploi in domest busi these seem but ordinari cattl howev thi confirm my first opinion that a peopl who could so far civilis brute anim must need excel in wisdom all the nation of the world the grai came in just after and therebi prevent ani ill treatment which the other might have given me he neigh to them sever time in a style of author and receiv answer beyond thi room there were three other reach the length of the hous to which you pass through three door opposit to each other in the manner of a vista we went through the second room toward the third here the grai walk in first beckon me to attend i wait in the second room and got readi my present for the master and mistress of the hous thei were two knive three bracelet of fals pearl a small look glass and a bead necklac the hors neigh three or four time and i wait to hear some answer in a human voic but i heard no other return than in the same dialect onli on or two a littl shriller than hi i began to think that thi hous must belong to some person of great note among them becaus there appear so much ceremoni befor i could gain admitt but that a man of qualiti should be serv all by hors wa beyond my comprehens i fear my brain wa disturb by my suffer and misfortun i rous myself and look about me in the room where i wa left alon thi wa furnish like the first onli after a more eleg manner i rub my ey often but the same object still occur i pinch my arm and side to awak myself hope i might be in a dream i then absolut conclud that all these appear could be noth els but necrom and magic but i had no time to pursu these reflect for the grai hors came to the door and made me a sign to follow him into the third room where i saw a veri come mare togeth with a colt and foal sit on their haunch upon mat of straw not unartfulli made and perfectli neat and clean the mare soon after my entranc rose from her mat and come up close after have nice observ my hand and face gave me a most contemptu look and turn to the hors i heard the word yahoo often repeat betwixt them the mean of which word i could not then comprehend although it wa the first i had learn to pronounc but i wa soon better inform to my everlast mortif for the hors beckon to me with hi head and repeat the hhuun hhuun as he did upon the road which i understood wa to attend him led me out into a kind of court where wa anoth build at some distanc from the hous here we enter and i saw three of those detest creatur which i first met after my land feed upon root and the flesh of some anim which i afterward found to be that of ass and dog and now and then a cow dead by accid or diseas thei were all ti by the neck with strong with fasten to a beam thei held their food between the claw of their fore feet and tore it with their teeth the master hors order a sorrel nag on of hi servant to unti the largest of these anim and take him into the yard the beast and i were brought close togeth and by our counten dilig compar both by master and servant who thereupon repeat sever time the word yahoo my horror and astonish ar not to be describ when i observ in thi abomin anim a perfect human figur the face of it inde wa flat and broad the nose depress the lip larg and the mouth wide but these differ ar common to all savag nation where the lineament of the counten ar distort by the nativ suffer their infant to lie grovel on the earth or by carri them on their back nuzzl with their face against the mother shoulder the fore feet of the yahoo differ from my hand in noth els but the length of the nail the coars and brown of the palm and the hairi on the back there wa the same resembl between our feet with the same differ which i knew veri well though the hors did not becaus of my shoe and stock the same in everi part of our bodi except as to hairi and colour which i have alreadi describ the great difficulti that seem to stick with the two hors wa to see the rest of my bodi so veri differ from that of a yahoo for which i wa oblig to my cloth whereof thei had no concept the sorrel nag offer me a root which he held after their manner as we shall describ in it proper place between hi hoof and pastern i took it in my hand and have smelt it return it to him again as civilli as i could he brought out of the yahoo kennel a piec of ass s flesh but it smelt so offens that i turn from it with loath he then threw it to the yahoo by whom it wa greedili devour he afterward show me a wisp of hai and a fetlock full of oat but i shook my head to signifi that neither of these were food for me and inde i now apprehend that i must absolut starv if i did not get to some of my own speci for as to those filthi yahoo although there were few greater lover of mankind at that time than myself yet i confess i never saw ani sensit be so detest on all account and the more i came near them the more hate thei grew while i stai in that countri thi the master hors observ by my behaviour and therefor sent the yahoo back to hi kennel he then put hi fore hoof to hi mouth at which i wa much surpris although he did it with eas and with a motion that appear perfectli natur and made other sign to know what i would eat but i could not return him such an answer as he wa abl to apprehend and if he had understood me i did not see how it wa possibl to contriv ani wai for find myself nourish while we were thu engag i observ a cow pass by whereupon i point to her and express a desir to go and milk her thi had it effect for he led me back into the hous and order a mare servant to open a room where a good store of milk lai in earthen and wooden vessel after a veri orderli and cleanli manner she gave me a larg bowl of which i drank veri heartili and found myself well refresh about noon i saw come toward the hous a kind of vehicl drawn like a sledg by four yahoo there wa in it an old steed who seem to be of qualiti he alight with hi hind feet forward have by accid got a hurt in hi left fore foot he came to dine with our hors who receiv him with great civil thei dine in the best room and had oat boil in milk for the second cours which the old hors at warm but the rest cold their manger were place circular in the middl of the room and divid into sever partit round which thei sat on their haunch upon boss of straw in the middl wa a larg rack with angl answer to everi partit of the manger so that each hors and mare at their own hai and their own mash of oat and milk with much decenc and regular the behaviour of the young colt and foal appear veri modest and that of the master and mistress extrem cheer and complais to their guest the grai order me to stand by him and much discours pass between him and hi friend concern me as i found by the stranger s often look on me and the frequent repetit of the word yahoo i happen to wear my glove which the master grai observ seem perplex discov sign of wonder what i had done to my fore feet he put hi hoof three or four time to them as if he would signifi that i should reduc them to their former shape which i present did pull off both my glove and put them into my pocket thi occas farther talk and i saw the compani wa pleas with my behaviour whereof i soon found the good effect i wa order to speak the few word i understood and while thei were at dinner the master taught me the name for oat milk fire water and some other which i could readili pronounc after him have from my youth a great facil in learn languag when dinner wa done the master hors took me asid and by sign and word made me understand the concern he wa in that i had noth to eat oat in their tongu ar call hlunnh thi word i pronounc two or three time for although i had refus them at first yet upon second thought i consid that i could contriv to make of them a kind of bread which might be suffici with milk to keep me aliv till i could make my escap to some other countri and to creatur of my own speci the hors immedi order a white mare servant of hi famili to bring me a good quantiti of oat in a sort of wooden trai these i heat befor the fire as well as i could and rub them till the husk came off which i made a shift to winnow from the grain i ground and beat them between two stone then took water and made them into a past or cake which i toast at the fire and eat warm with milk it wa at first a veri insipid diet though common enough in mani part of europ but grew toler by time and have been often reduc to hard fare in my life thi wa not the first experi i had made how easili natur is satisfi and i cannot but observ that i never had on hour sick while i stai in thi island it is true i sometim made a shift to catch a rabbit or bird by spring made of yahoo s hair and i often gather wholesom herb which i boil and at as salad with my bread and now and then for a rariti i made a littl butter and drank the whei i wa at first at a great loss for salt but custom soon reconcil me to the want of it and i am confid that the frequent us of salt among us is an effect of luxuri and wa first introduc onli as a provoc to drink except where it is necessari for preserv flesh in long voyag or in place remot from great market for we observ no anim to be fond of it but man and as to myself when i left thi countri it wa a great while befor i could endur the tast of it in anyth that i at thi is enough to sai upon the subject of my diet wherewith other travel fill their book as if the reader were person concern whether we fare well or ill howev it wa necessari to mention thi matter lest the world should think it imposs that i could find susten for three year in such a countri and among such inhabit when it grew toward even the master hors order a place for me to lodg in it wa but six yard from the hous and separ from the stabl of the yahoo here i got some straw and cover

that a brute anim should discov such mark of a ration creatur i point to everi thing and inquir the name of it which i wrote down in my journal book when i wa alon and correct my bad accent by desir those of the famili to pronounc it often in thi employ a sorrel nag on of the under servant wa veri readi to assist me in speak thei pronounc through the nose and throat and their languag approach nearest to the high dutch or german of ani i know in europ but is much more grace and signific the emperor charl v made almost the same observ when he said that if he were to speak to hi hors it should be in high dutch the curios and impati of my master were so great that he spent mani hour of hi leisur to instruct me he wa convinc as he afterward told me that i must be a yahoo but my teachabl civil and cleanli astonish him which were qualiti altogeth opposit to those anim he wa most perplex about my cloth reason sometim with himself whether thei were a part of my bodi for i never

to know my stori from my own mouth which he hope he should soon do by the great profici i made in learn and pronounc their word and sentenc to help my memori i form all i learn into the english alphabet and writ the word down with the translat thi last after some time i ventur to do in my master s presenc it cost me much troubl to explain to him what i wa do for the inhabit have not the least idea of book or literatur in about ten week time i wa abl to understand most of hi question and in three month could give him some toler answer he wa extrem curiou to know from what part of the countri i came and how i wa taught to imit a ration creatur becaus the yahoo whom he saw i exactli resembl in my head hand and face that were onli visibl with some appear of cun and the strongest disposit to mischief were observ to be the most unteach of all brute i answer that i came over the sea from a far place with mani other of my own kind in a great hollow vessel made of the bodi of tree that my companion forc me to land on thi coast and then left me to shift for myself it wa with some difficulti and by the help of mani sign that i brought him to understand me he repli that i must need be mistaken or that i said the thing which wa not for thei have no word in their languag to express ly or falsehood he knew it wa imposs that there could be a countri beyond the sea or that a parcel of brute could move a wooden vessel whither thei pleas upon water he wa sure no houyhnhnm aliv could make such a vessel nor would trust yahoo to manag it the word houyhnhnm in their tongu signifi a hors and in it etymolog the perfect of natur i told my master that i wa at a loss for express but would improv as fast as i could and hope in a short time i should be abl to tell him wonder he wa pleas to direct hi own mare hi colt and foal and the servant of the famili to take all opportun of instruct me and everi dai for two or three hour he wa at the same pain himself sever hors and mare of qualiti in the neighbourhood came often to our hous upon the report spread of a wonder yahoo that could speak like a houyhnhnm and seem in hi word and action to discov some glimmer of reason these delight to convers with me thei put mani question and receiv such answer as i wa abl to return by all these advantag i made so great a progress that in five month from my arriv i understood whatev wa spoken and could express myself toler well the houyhnhnm who came to visit my master out of a design of see and talk with me could hardli believ me to be a right yahoo becaus my bodi had a differ cover from other of my kind thei were astonish to observ me without the usual hair or skin except on my head face and hand but i discov that secret to my master upon an accid which happen about a fortnight befor i have alreadi told the reader that everi night when the famili were gone to bed it wa my custom to strip and cover myself with my cloth it happen on morn earli that my master sent for me by the sorrel nag who wa hi valet when he came i wa fast asleep my cloth fallen off on on side and my shirt abov my waist i awak at the nois he made and observ him to deliv hi messag in some disord after which he went to my master and in a great fright gave him a veri confus account of what he had seen thi i present discov for go as soon as i wa dress to pai my attend upon hi honour he ask me the mean of what hi servant had report that i wa not the same thing when i slept as i appear to be at other time that hi vale assur him some part of me wa white some yellow at least not so white and some brown i had hitherto conceal the secret of my dress in order to distinguish myself as much as possibl from that curs race of yahoo but now i found it in vain to do so ani longer besid i consid that my cloth and shoe would soon wear out which alreadi were in a declin condit and must be suppli by some contriv from the hide of yahoo or other brute wherebi the whole secret would be known i therefor told my master that in the countri whenc i came those of my kind alwai cover their bodi with the hair of certain anim prepar by art as well for decenc as to avoid the inclem of air both hot and cold of which as to my own person i would give him immedi convict if he pleas to command me onli desir hi excus if i did not expos those part that natur taught us to conceal he said my discours wa all veri strang but especi the last part for he could not understand why natur should teach us to conceal what natur had given that neither himself nor famili were asham of ani part of their bodi but howev i might do as i pleas whereupon i first unbutton my coat and pull it off i did the same with my waistcoat i drew off my shoe stock and breech i let my shirt down to my waist and drew up the bottom fasten it like a girdl about my middl to hide my naked my master observ the whole perform with great sign of curios and admir he took up all my cloth in hi pastern on piec after anoth and examin them dilig he then stroke my bodi veri gentli and look round me sever time after which he said it wa plain i must be a perfect yahoo but that i differ veri much from the rest of my speci in the soft white and smooth of my skin my want of hair in sever part of my bodi the shape and short of my claw behind and befor and my affect of walk continu on my two hinder feet he desir to see no more and gave me leav to put on my cloth again for i wa shudder with cold i express my uneasi at hi give me so often the appel of yahoo an odiou anim for which i had so utter a hatr and contempt i beg he would forbear appli that word to me and make the same order in hi famili and among hi friend whom he suffer to see me i request likewis that the secret of my have a fals cover to my bodi might be known to none but himself at least as long as my present cloth should last for as to what the sorrel nag hi valet had observ hi honour might command him to conceal it all thi my master veri gracious consent to and thu the secret wa kept till my cloth began to wear out which i wa forc to suppli by sever contriv that shall hereaft be mention in the meantim he desir i would go on with my utmost dilig to learn their languag becaus he wa more astonish at my capac for speech and reason than at the figur of my bodi whether it were cover or not ad that he wait with some impati to hear the wonder which i promis to tell him thenceforward he doubl the pain he had been at to instruct me he brought me into all compani and made them treat me with civil becaus as he told them privat thi would put me into good humour and make me more divert everi dai when i wait on him besid the troubl he wa at in teach he would ask me sever question concern myself which i answer as well as i could and by these mean he had alreadi receiv some gener idea though veri imperfect it would be tediou to relat the sever step by which i advanc to a more regular convers but the first account i gave of myself in ani order and length wa to thi purpos that i came from a veri far countri as i alreadi had attempt to tell him with about fifti more of my own speci that we travel upon the sea in a great hollow vessel made of wood and larger than hi honour s hous i describ the ship to him in the best term i could and explain by the help of my handkerchief displai how it wa driven forward by the wind that upon a quarrel among us i wa set on shore on thi coast where i walk forward without know whither till he deliv me from the persecut of those execr yahoo he ask me who made the ship and how it wa possibl that the houyhnhnm of my countri would leav it to the manag of brute my answer wa that i durst proce no further in my relat unless he would give me hi word and honour that he would not be offend and then i would tell him the wonder i had so often promis he agre and i went on by assur him that the ship wa made by creatur like myself who in all the countri i had travel as well as in my own were the onli govern ration anim and that upon my arriv hither i wa as much astonish to see the houyhnhnm act like ration be as he or hi friend could be in find some mark of reason in a creatur he wa pleas to call a yahoo to which i own my resembl in everi part but could not account for their degener and brutal natur i said farther that if good fortun ever restor me to my nativ countri to relat my travel hither as i resolv to do everybodi would believ that i said the thing that wa not that i invent the stori out of my own head and with all possibl respect to himself hi famili and friend and under hi promis of not be offend our countrymen would hardli think it probabl that a houyhnhnm should be the presid creatur of a nation and a yahoo the brute chapter iv the houyhnhnm s notion of truth and falsehood the author s discours disapprov by hi master the author give a more particular account of himself and the accid of hi voyag my master heard me with great appear of uneasi in hi counten becaus doubt or not believ ar so littl known in thi countri that the inhabit cannot tell how to behav themselv under such circumst and i rememb in frequent discours with my master concern the natur of manhood in other part of the world have occas to talk of ly and fals represent it wa with much difficulti that he comprehend what i meant although he had otherwis a most acut judgment for he argu thu that the us of speech wa to make us understand on anoth and to receiv inform of fact now if ani on said the thing which wa not these end were defeat becaus i cannot properli be said to understand him and i am so far from receiv inform that he leav me wors than in ignor for i am led to believ a thing black when it is white and short when it is long and these were all the notion he had concern that faculti of ly so perfectli well understood and so univers practis among human creatur to return from thi digress when i assert that the yahoo were the onli govern anim in my countri which my master said wa altogeth past hi concept he desir to know whether we had houyhnhnm among us and what wa their employ i told him we had great number that in summer thei graze in the field and in winter were kept in

veri plain from all you have spoken that whatev share of reason the yahoo pretend to the houyhnhnm ar your master i heartili wish our yahoo would be so tractabl i beg hi honour would pleas to excus me from proceed ani further becaus i wa veri certain that the account he expect from me would be highli displeas but he insist in command me to let him know the best and the worst i told him he should be obei i own that the houyhnhnm among us whom we call hors were the most gener and come anim we had that thei excel in strength and swift and when thei belong to person of qualiti were emploi in travel race or draw chariot thei were treat with much kind and care till thei fell into diseas or becam founder in the feet but then thei were sold and us to all kind of drudgeri till thei di after which their skin were strip and sold for what thei were worth and their bodi left to be devour by dog and bird of prei but the common race of hors had not so good fortun be kept by farmer and carrier and other mean peopl who put them to greater labour and fed them wors i describ as well as i could our wai of ride the shape and us of a bridl a saddl a spur and a whip of har and wheel i ad that we fasten plate of a certain hard substanc call iron at the bottom of their feet to preserv their hoof from be broken by the stoni wai on which we often travel my master after some express of great indign wonder how we dare to ventur upon a houyhnhnm s back for he wa sure that the weakest servant in hi hous would be abl to shake off the strongest yahoo or by ly down and roll on hi back squeez the brute to death i answer that our hors were train up from three or four year old to the sever us we intend them for that if ani of them prove intoler viciou thei were emploi for carriag that thei were sever beaten while thei were young for ani mischiev trick that the male design for the common us of ride or draught were gener castrat about two year after their birth to take down their spirit and make them more tame and gentl that thei were inde sensibl of reward and punish but hi honour would pleas to consid that thei had not the least tinctur of reason ani more than the yahoo in thi countri it put me to the pain of mani circumlocut to give my master a right idea of what i spoke for their languag doe not abound in varieti of word becaus their want and passion ar fewer than among us but it is imposs to express hi nobl resent at our savag treatment of the houyhnhnm race particularli after i had explain the manner and us of castrat hors among us to hinder them from propag their kind and to render them more servil he said if it were possibl there could be ani countri where yahoo alon were endu with reason thei certainli must be the govern anim becaus reason in time will alwai prevail against brutal strength but consid the frame of our bodi and especi of mine he thought no creatur of equal bulk wa so ill contriv for emploi that reason in the common offic of life whereupon he desir to know whether those among whom i live resembl me or the yahoo of hi countri i assur him that i wa as well shape as most of my ag but the younger and the femal were much more soft and tender and the skin of the latter gener as white as milk he said i differ inde from other yahoo be much more cleanli and not altogeth so deform but in point of real advantag he thought i differ for the wors that my nail were of no us either to my fore or hinder feet as to my fore feet he could not properli call them by that name for he never observ me to walk upon them that thei were too soft to bear the ground that i gener went with them uncov neither wa the cover i sometim wore on them of the same shape or so strong as that on my feet behind that i could not walk with ani secur for if either of my hinder feet slip i must inevit fail he then began to find fault with other part of my bodi the flat of my face the promin of my nose mine ey place directli in front so that i could not look on either side without turn my head that i wa not abl to feed myself without lift on of my fore feet to my mouth and therefor natur had place those joint to answer that necess he knew not what could be the us of those sever cleft and divis in my feet behind that these were too soft to bear the hard and sharp of stone without a cover made from the skin of some other brute that my whole bodi want a fenc against heat and cold which i wa forc to put on and off everi dai with tedious and troubl and lastli that he observ everi anim in thi countri natur to abhor the yahoo whom the weaker avoid and the stronger drove from them so that suppos us to have the gift of reason he could not see how it were possibl to cure that natur antipathi which everi creatur discov against us nor consequ how we could tame and render them servic howev he would as he said debat the matter no farther becaus he wa more desir to know my own stori the countri where i wa born and the sever action and event of my life befor i came hither i assur him how extrem desir i wa that he should be satisfi on everi point but i doubt much whether it would be possibl for me to explain myself on sever subject whereof hi honour could have no concept becaus i saw noth in hi countri to which i could resembl them that howev i would do my best and strive to express myself by similitud humbl desir hi assist when i want proper word which he wa pleas to promis me i said my birth wa of honest parent in an island call england which wa remot from hi countri as mani dai journei as the strongest of hi honour s servant could travel in the annual cours of the sun that i wa bred a surgeon whose trade it is to cure wound and hurt in the bodi gotten by accid or violenc that my countri wa govern by a femal man whom we call queen that i left it to get rich wherebi i might maintain myself and famili when i should return that in my last voyag i wa command of the ship and had about fifti yahoo under me mani of which di at sea and i wa forc to suppli them by other pick out from sever nation that our ship wa twice in danger of be sunk the first time by a great storm and the second by strike against a rock here my master interpos by ask me how i could persuad stranger out of differ countri to ventur with me after the loss i had sustain and the hazard i had run i said thei were fellow of desper fortun forc to fly from the place of their birth on account of their poverti or their crime some were undon by lawsuit other spent all thei had in drink whore and game other fled for treason mani for murder theft poison robberi perjuri forgeri coin fals monei for commit rape or sodomi for fly from their colour or desert to the enemi and most of them had broken prison none of these durst return to their nativ countri for fear of be hang or of starv in a jail and therefor thei were under the necess of seek a livelihood in other place dure thi discours my master wa pleas to interrupt me sever time i had made us of mani circumlocut in describ to him the natur of the sever crime for which most of our crew had been forc to fly their countri thi labour took up sever dai convers befor he wa abl to comprehend me he wa wholli at a loss to know what could be the us or necess of practis those vice to clear up which i endeavour to give some idea of the desir of power and rich of the terribl effect of lust intemper malic and envi all thi i wa forc to defin and describ by put case and make supposit after which like on whose imagin wa struck with someth never seen or heard of befor he would lift up hi ey with amaz and indign power govern war law punish and a thousand other thing had no term wherein that languag could express them which made the difficulti almost insuper to give my master ani concept of what i meant but be of an excel understand much improv by contempl and convers he at last arriv at a compet knowledg of what human natur in our part of the world is capabl to perform and desir i would give him some particular account of that land which we call europ but especi of my own countri chapter v the author at hi master s command inform him of the state of england the caus of war among the princ of europ the author begin to explain the english constitut the reader mai pleas to observ that the follow extract of mani convers i had with my master contain a summari of the most materi point which were discours at sever time for abov two year hi honour often desir fuller satisfact as i farther improv in the houyhnhnm tongu i laid befor him as well as i could the whole state of europ i discours of trade and manufactur of art and scienc and the answer i gave to all the question he made as thei aros upon sever subject were a fund of convers not to be exhaust but i shall here onli set down the substanc of what pass between us concern my own countri reduc it in order as well as i can without ani regard to time or other circumst while i strictli adher to truth my onli concern is that i shall hardli be abl to do justic to my master s argument and express which must need suffer by my want of capac as well as by a translat into our barbar english in obedi therefor to hi honour s command i relat to him the revolut under the princ of orang the long war with franc enter into by the said princ and renew by hi successor the present queen wherein the greatest power of christendom were engag and which still continu i comput at hi request that about a million of yahoo might have been kill in the whole progress of it and perhap a hundr or more citi taken and five time as mani ship burnt or sunk he ask me what were the usual caus or motiv that made on countri go to war with anoth i answer thei were innumer but i should onli mention a few of the chief sometim the ambit of princ who never think thei have land or peopl enough to govern sometim the corrupt of minist who engag their master in a war in order to stifl or divert the clamour of the subject against their evil administr differ in opinion ha cost mani million of live for instanc whether flesh be bread or bread be flesh whether the juic of a certain berri be blood or wine whether whistl be a vice or a virtu whether it be better to kiss a post or throw it into the fire what is the best colour for a coat whether black white red or grai and whether it should be long or short narrow or wide dirti or clean with mani more neither ar ani war so furiou and bloodi or of so long a continu as those occas by differ in opinion especi if it be in thing indiffer sometim the quarrel between two princ is to decid which of them shall dispossess a third of hi dominion where neither of them pretend to ani right sometim on princ quarrel with anoth for fear the other should quarrel with him sometim a war is enter upon becaus the enemi is too strong and sometim becaus he is too weak sometim our neighbour want the thing which we have or have the thing which we want and we both fight till thei take our or give us their it is a veri justifi caus of a war to invad a countri after the peopl have been wast by famin destroi by pestil or embroil by faction among themselv it is justifi to enter into war against our nearest alli when on of hi town li conveni for us or a territori of land that would render our dominion round and complet if a princ send forc into a nation where the peopl ar poor and ignor he mai lawfulli put half of them to death and make slave of the rest in order to civil and reduc them from their barbar wai of live it is a veri kingli honour and frequent practic when on princ desir the assist of anoth to secur him against an invas that the assist when he ha driven out the invad should seiz on the dominion himself and kill imprison or banish the princ he came to reliev allianc by blood or marriag is a frequent caus of war between princ and the nearer the kindr is the greater their disposit to quarrel poor nation ar hungri and rich nation ar proud and pride and hunger will ever be at varianc for these reason the trade of a soldier is held the most honour of all other becaus a soldier is a yahoo hire to kill in cold blood as mani of hi own speci who have never offend him as possibl he can there is likewis a kind of beggarli princ in europ not abl to make war by themselv who hire out their troop to richer nation for so much a dai to each man of which thei keep three fourth to themselv and it is the best part of their mainten such ar those in mani northern part of europ what you have told me said my master upon the subject of war doe inde discov most admir the effect of that reason you pretend to howev it is happi that the shame is greater than the danger and that natur ha left you utterli incap of do much mischief for your mouth ly flat with your face you can hardli bite each other to ani purpos unless by consent then as to the claw upon your feet befor and behind thei ar so short and tender that on of our yahoo would drive a dozen of your befor him and therefor in recount the number of those who have been kill in battl i cannot but think you have said the thing which is not i could not forbear shake my head and smile a littl at hi ignor and be no stranger to the art of war i gave him a descript of cannon culverin musket carabin pistol bullet powder sword bayonet battl sieg retreat attack undermin countermin bombard sea fight ship sunk with a thousand men twenti thousand kill on each side dy groan limb fly in the air smoke nois confus trampl to death under hors feet flight pursuit victori field strew with carcas left for food to dog and wolv and bird of prei plunder strip ravish burn and destroi and to set forth the valour of my own dear countrymen i assur him that i had seen them blow up a hundr enemi at onc in a sieg and as mani in a ship and beheld the dead bodi drop down in piec from the cloud to the great divers of the spectat i wa go on to more particular when my master command me silenc he said whoever understood the natur of yahoo might easili believ it possibl for so vile an anim to be capabl of everi action i had name if their strength and cun equal their malic but as my discours had increas hi abhorr of the whole speci so he found it gave him a disturb in hi mind to which he wa wholli a stranger befor he thought hi ear be us to such abomin word might by degre admit them with less detest that although he hate the yahoo of thi countri yet he no more blame them for their odiou qualiti than he did a gnnayh a bird of prei for it cruelti or a sharp stone for cut hi hoof but when a creatur pretend to reason could be capabl of such enorm he dread lest the corrupt of that faculti might be wors than brutal itself he seem therefor confid that instead of reason we were onli possess of some qualiti fit to increas our natur vice as the reflect from a troubl stream return the imag of an ill shapen bodi not onli larger but more distort he ad that he had heard too much upon the subject of war both in thi and some former discours there wa anoth point which a littl perplex him at present i had inform him that some of our crew left their countri on account of be ruin by law that i had alreadi explain the mean of the word but he wa at a loss how it should come to pass that the law which wa intend for everi man s preserv should be ani man s ruin therefor he desir to be further satisfi what i meant by law and the dispens thereof accord to the present practic in my own countri becaus he thought natur and reason were suffici guid for a reason anim as we pretend to be in show us what he ought to do and what to avoid i assur hi honour that the law wa a scienc in which i had not much convers further than by emploi advoc in vain upon some injustic that had been done me howev i would give him all the satisfact i wa abl i said there wa a societi of men among us bred up from their youth in the art of prove by word multipli for the purpos that white is black and black is white accord as thei ar paid to thi societi all the rest of the peopl ar slave for exampl if my neighbour ha a mind to my cow he ha a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow from me i must then hire anoth to defend my right it be against all rule of law that ani man should be allow to speak for himself now in thi case i who am the right owner lie under two great disadvantag first my lawyer be practis almost from hi cradl in defend falsehood is quit out of hi element when he would be an advoc for justic which is an unnatur offic he alwai attempt with great awkward if not with ill will the second disadvantag is that my lawyer must proce with great caution or els he will be reprimand by the judg and abhor by hi brethren as on that would lessen the practic of the law and therefor i have but two method to preserv my cow the first is to gain over my adversari s lawyer with a doubl fee who will then betrai hi client by insinu that he hath justic on hi side the second wai is for my lawyer to make my caus appear as unjust as he can by allow the cow to belong to my adversari and thi if it be skilfulli done will certainli bespeak the favour of the bench now your honour is to know that these judg ar person appoint to decid all controversi of properti as well as for the trial of crimin and pick out from the most dexter lawyer who ar grown old or lazi and have been biass all their live against truth and equiti lie under such a fatal necess of favour fraud perjuri and oppress that i have known some of them refus a larg bribe from the side where justic lai rather than injur the faculti by do ani thing unbecom their natur or their offic it is a maxim among these lawyer that whatev ha been done befor mai legal be done again and therefor thei take special care to record all the decis formerli made against common justic and the gener reason of mankind these under the name of preced thei produc as author to justifi the most iniquit opinion and the judg never fail of direct accordingli in plead thei studious avoid enter into the merit of the caus but ar loud violent and tediou in dwell upon all circumst which ar not to the purpos for instanc in the case alreadi mention thei never desir to know what claim or titl my adversari ha to my cow but whether the said cow were red or black her horn long or short whether the field i graze her in be round or squar whether she wa milk at home or abroad what diseas she is subject to and the like after which thei consult preced adjourn the caus from time to time and in ten twenti or thirti year come to an issu it is likewis to be observ that thi societi ha a peculiar cant and jargon of their own that no other mortal can understand and wherein all their law ar written which thei take special care to multipli wherebi thei have wholli confound the veri essenc of truth and falsehood of right and wrong so that it will take thirti year to decid whether the field left me by my ancestor for six gener belong to me or to a stranger three hundr mile off in the trial of person accus for crime against the state the method is much more short and commend the judg first send to sound the disposit of those in power after which he can easili hang or save a crimin strictli preserv all due form of law here my master interpos said it wa a piti that creatur endow with such prodigi abil of mind as these lawyer by the descript i gave of them must certainli be were not rather encourag to be instructor of other in wisdom and knowledg in answer to which i assur hi honour that in all point out of their own trade thei were usual the most ignor and stupid gener among us the most despic in common convers avow enemi to all knowledg and learn and equal dispos to pervert the gener reason of mankind in everi other subject of discours as in that of their own profess chapter vi a continu of the state of england under queen ann the charact of a first minist of state in european court my master wa yet wholli at a loss to understand what motiv could incit thi race of lawyer to perplex disquiet and weari themselv and engag in a confederaci of injustic mere for the sake of injur their fellow anim neither could he comprehend what i meant in sai thei did it for hire whereupon i wa at much pain to describ to him the us of monei the materi it wa made of and the valu of the metal that when a yahoo had got a great store of thi preciou substanc he wa abl to purchas whatev he had a mind to the finest cloth the noblest hous great tract of land the most costli meat and drink and have hi choic of the most beauti femal therefor sinc monei alon wa abl to perform all these feat our yahoo thought thei could never have enough of it to spend or to save as thei found themselv inclin from their natur bent either to profus or avaric that the rich man enjoi the fruit of the poor man s labour and the latter were a thousand to on in proport to the former that the bulk of our peopl were forc to live miser by labour everi dai for small wage to make a few live plentifulli i enlarg myself much on these and mani other particular to the same purpos but hi honour wa still to seek for he went upon a supposit that all anim had a titl to their share in the product of the earth and especi those who presid over the rest therefor he desir i would let him know what these costli meat were and how ani of us happen to want them whereupon i enumer as mani sort as came into my head with the variou method of dress them which could not be done without send vessel by sea to everi part of the world as well for liquor to drink as for sauc and innumer other conveni i assur him that thi whole globe of earth must be at least three time gone round befor on of our better femal yahoo could get her breakfast or a cup to put it in he said that must need be a miser countri which cannot furnish food for it own inhabit but what he chiefli wonder at wa how such vast tract of ground as i describ should be wholli without fresh water and the peopl put to the necess of send over the sea for drink i repli that england the dear place of my nativ wa comput to produc three time the quantiti of food more than it inhabit ar abl to consum as well as liquor extract from grain or press out of the fruit of certain tree which made excel drink and the same proport in everi other conveni of life but in order to feed the luxuri and intemper of the male and the vaniti of the femal we sent awai the greatest part of our necessari thing to other countri whenc in return we brought the materi of diseas folli and vice to spend among ourselv henc it follow of

freethink and the like occup everi on of which term i wa at much pain to make him understand that wine wa not import among us from foreign countri to suppli the want of water or other drink but becaus it wa a sort of liquid which made us merri by put us out of our sens divert all melancholi thought begat wild extravag imagin in the brain rais our hope and banish our fear suspend everi offic of reason for a time and depriv us of the us of our limb till we fell into a profound sleep although it must be confess that we alwai awak sick and dispirit and that the us of thi liquor fill us with

brought him to apprehend what i meant he could easili conceiv that a houyhnhnm grew weak and heavi a few dai befor hi death or by some accid might hurt a limb but that natur who work all thing to perfect should suffer ani pain to breed in our bodi he thought imposs and desir to know the reason of so unaccount an evil i told him we fed on a thousand thing which oper contrari to each other that

had fallen whereof we made no other us than by it assist to aggrav our natur corrupt and to acquir new on which natur had not given us that we disarm ourselv of the few abil she had bestow had been veri success in multipli our origin want and seem to spend our whole live in vain endeavour to suppli them by our own invent that as to myself it wa manifest i had neither the strength nor agil of a common yahoo that i walk infirmli on my hinder feet had found out a contriv to make my claw of no us or defenc and to remov the hair from my chin which wa intend as a shelter from the sun and the weather lastli that i could neither run with speed nor climb tree like my brethren as he call them the yahoo in hi countri that our institut of govern and law were plainli ow to our gross defect in reason and by consequ in virtu becaus reason alon is suffici to govern a ration creatur which wa therefor a charact we had no pretenc to challeng even from the account i had given of my own peopl although he manifestli perceiv that in order to favour them i had conceal mani particular and often said the thing which wa not he wa the more confirm in thi opinion becaus he observ that as i agre in everi featur of my bodi with other yahoo except where it wa to my real disadvantag in point of strength speed and activ the short of my claw and some other particular where natur had no part so from the represent i had given him of our live our manner and our action he found as near a resembl in the disposit of our mind he said the yahoo were known to hate on anoth more than thei did ani differ speci of anim and the reason usual assign wa the odious of their own shape which all could see in the rest but not in themselv he had therefor begun to think it not unwis in us to cover our bodi and by that invent conceal mani of our deform from each other which would els be hardli support but he now found he had been mistaken and that the dissens of those brute in hi countri were ow to the same caus with our as i had describ them for if said he you throw among five yahoo as much food as would be suffici for fifti thei will instead of eat peaceabl fall togeth by the ear each singl on impati to have all to itself and therefor a servant wa usual emploi to stand by while thei were feed abroad and those kept at home were ti at a distanc from each other that if a cow di of ag or accid befor a houyhnhnm could secur it for hi own yahoo those in the neighbourhood would come in herd to seiz it and then would ensu such a battl as i had describ with terribl wound made by their claw on both side although thei seldom were abl to kill on anoth for want of such conveni instrument of death as we had invent at other time the like battl have been fought between the yahoo of sever neighbourhood without ani visibl caus those of on district watch all opportun to surpris the next befor thei ar prepar but if thei find their project ha miscarri thei return home and for want of enemi engag in what i call a civil war among themselv that in some field of hi countri there ar certain shine stone of sever colour whereof the yahoo ar violent fond and when part of these stone is fix in the earth as it sometim happen thei will dig with their claw for whole dai to get them out then carri them awai and hide them by heap in their kennel but still look round with great caution for fear their comrad should find out their treasur my master said he could never discov the reason of thi unnatur appetit or how these stone could be of ani us to a yahoo but now he believ it might proce from the same principl of avaric which i had ascrib to mankind that he had onc by wai of experi privat remov a heap of these stone from the place where on of hi yahoo had buri it whereupon the sordid anim miss hi treasur by hi loud lament brought the whole herd to the place there miser howl then fell to bite and tear the rest began to pine awai would neither eat nor sleep nor work till he order a servant privat to convei the stone into the same hole and hide them as befor which when hi yahoo had found he present recov hi spirit and good humour but took good care to remov them to a better hide place and ha ever sinc been a veri servic brute my master further assur me which i also observ myself that in the field where the shine stone abound the fiercest and most frequent battl ar fought occas by perpetu inroad of the neighbour yahoo he said it wa common when two yahoo discov such a stone in a field and were contend which of them should be the proprietor a third would take the advantag and carri it awai from them both which my master would need contend to have some kind of resembl with our suit at law wherein i thought it for our credit not to undec him sinc the decis he mention wa much more equit than mani decre among us becaus the plaintiff and defend there lost noth besid the stone thei contend for wherea our court of equiti would never have dismiss the caus while either of them had ani thing left my master continu hi discours said there wa noth that render the yahoo more odiou than their undistinguish appetit to devour everi thing that came in their wai whether herb root berri the corrupt flesh of anim or all mingl togeth and it wa peculiar in their temper that thei were fonder of what thei could get by rapin or stealth at a greater distanc than much better food provid for them at home if their prei held out thei would eat till thei were readi to burst after which natur had point out to them a certain root that gave them a gener evacu there wa also anoth kind of root veri juici but somewhat rare and difficult to be found which the yahoo sought for with much eager and would suck it with great delight it produc in them the same effect that wine ha upon us it would make them sometim hug and sometim tear on anoth thei would howl and grin and chatter and reel and tumbl and then fall asleep in the mud i did inde observ that the yahoo were the onli anim in thi countri subject to ani diseas which howev were much fewer than hors have among us and contract not by ani ill treatment thei meet with but by the nasti and greedi of that sordid brute neither ha their languag ani more than a gener appel for those maladi which is borrow from the name of the beast and call hnea yahoo or yahoo s evil and the cure prescrib is a mixtur of their own dung and urin forcibl put down the yahoo s throat thi i have sinc often known to have been taken with success and do here freeli recommend it to my countrymen for the public good as an admir specif against all diseas produc by replet as to learn govern art manufactur and the like my master confess he could find littl or no resembl between the yahoo of that countri and those in our for he onli meant to observ what pariti there wa in our natur he had heard inde some curiou houyhnhnm observ that in most herd there wa a sort of rule yahoo as among us there is gener some lead or princip stag in a park who wa alwai more deform in bodi and mischiev in disposit than ani of the rest that thi leader had usual a favourit as like himself as he could get whose employ wa to lick hi master s feet and posterior and drive the femal yahoo to hi kennel for which he wa now and then reward with a piec of ass s flesh thi favourit is hate by the whole herd and therefor to protect himself keep alwai near the person of hi leader he usual continu in offic till a wors can be found but the veri moment he is discard hi successor at the head of all the yahoo in that district young and old male and femal come in a bodi and discharg their excrement upon him from head to foot but how far thi might be applic to our court and favourit and minist of state my master said i could best determin i durst make no return to thi malici insinu which debas human understand below the sagac of a common hound who ha judgment enough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the pack without be ever mistaken my master told me there were some qualiti remark in the yahoo which he had not observ me to mention or at least veri slightli in the account i had given of humankind he said those anim like other brute had their femal in common but in thi thei differ that the she yahoo would admit the male while she wa pregnant and that the he would quarrel and fight with the femal as fierc as with each other both which practic were such degre of infam brutal as no other sensit creatur ever arriv at anoth thing he wonder at in the yahoo wa their strang disposit to nasti and dirt wherea there appear to be a natur love of cleanli in all other anim as to the two former accus i wa glad to let them pass without ani repli becaus i had not a word to offer upon them in defenc of my speci which otherwis i certainli had done from my own inclin but i could have easili vindic humankind from the imput of singular upon the last articl if there had been ani swine in that countri as unluckili for me there were not which although it mai be a sweeter quadrup than a yahoo cannot i humbl conceiv in justic pretend to more cleanli and so hi honour himself must have own if he had seen their filthi wai of feed and their custom of wallow and sleep in the mud my master likewis mention anoth qualiti which hi servant had discov in sever yahoo and to him wa wholli unaccount he said a fanci would sometim take a yahoo to retir into a corner to lie down and howl and groan and spurn awai all that came near him although he were young and fat want neither food nor water nor did the servant imagin what could possibl ail him and the onli remedi thei found wa to set him to hard work after which he would infal come to himself to thi i wa silent out of partial to my own kind yet here i could plainli discov the true seed of spleen which onli seiz on the lazi the luxuri and the rich who if thei were forc to undergo the same regimen i would undertak for the cure hi honour had further observ that a femal yahoo would often stand behind a bank or a bush to gaze on the young male pass by and then appear and hide us mani antic gestur and grimac at which time it wa observ that she had a most offens smell and when ani of the male advanc would slowli retir look often back and with a counterfeit show of fear run off into some conveni place where she knew the male would follow her at other time if a femal stranger came among them three or four of her own sex would get about her and stare and chatter and grin and smell her all over and then turn off with gestur that seem to express contempt and disdain perhap my master might refin a littl in these specul which he had drawn from what he observ himself or had been told him by other howev i could not reflect without some amaz and much sorrow that the rudiment of lewd coquetri censur and scandal should have place by instinct in womankind i expect everi moment that my master would accus the yahoo of those unnatur appetit in both sex so common among us but natur it seem ha not been so expert a school mistress and these polit pleasur ar entir the product of art and reason on our side of the globe chapter viii the author relat sever particular of the yahoo the great virtu of the houyhnhnm the educ and exercis of their youth their gener assembl as i ought to have understood human natur much better than i suppos it possibl for my master to do so it wa easi to appli the charact he gave of the yahoo to myself and my countrymen and i believ i could yet make further discoveri from my own observ i therefor often beg hi honour to let me go among the herd of yahoo in the neighbourhood to which he alwai veri gracious consent be perfectli convinc that the hatr i bore these brute would never suffer me to be corrupt by them and hi honour order on of hi servant a strong sorrel nag veri honest and good natur to be my guard without whose protect i durst not undertak such adventur for i have alreadi told the reader how much i wa pester by these odiou anim upon my first arriv and i afterward fail veri narrowli three or four time of fall into their clutch when i happen to strai at ani distanc without my hanger and i have reason to believ thei had some imagin that i wa of their own speci which i often assist myself by strip up my sleev and show my nake arm and breast in their sight when my protector wa with me at which time thei would approach as near as thei durst and imit my action after the manner of monkei but ever with great sign of hatr as a tame jackdaw with cap and stock is alwai persecut by the wild on when he happen to be got among them thei ar prodigi nimbl from their infanc howev i onc caught a young male of three year old and endeavour by all mark of tender to make it quiet but the littl imp fell a squall and scratch and bite with such violenc that i wa forc to let it go and it wa high time for a whole troop of old on came about us at the nois but find the cub wa safe for awai it ran and my sorrel nag be by thei durst not ventur near us i observ the young anim s flesh to smell veri rank and the stink wa somewhat between a weasel and a fox but much more disagre i forgot anoth circumst and perhap i might have the reader s pardon if it were wholli omit that while i held the odiou vermin in my hand it void it filthi excrement of a yellow liquid substanc all over my cloth but by good fortun there wa a small brook hard by where i wash myself as clean as i could although i durst not come into my master s presenc until i were suffici air by what i could discov the yahoo appear to be the most unteach of all anim their capac never reach higher than to draw or carri burden yet i am of opinion thi defect aris chiefli from a pervers restiv disposit for thei ar cun malici treacher and reveng thei ar strong and hardi but of a cowardli spirit and by consequ insol abject and cruel it is observ that the red hair of both sex ar more libidin and mischiev than the rest whom yet thei much exce in strength and activ the houyhnhnm keep the yahoo for present us in hut not far from the hous but the rest ar sent abroad to certain field where thei dig up root eat sever kind of herb and search about for carrion or sometim catch weasel and luhimuh a sort of wild rat which thei greedili devour natur ha taught them to dig deep hole with their nail on the side of a rise ground wherein thei lie by themselv onli the kennel of the femal ar larger suffici to hold two or three cub thei swim from their infanc like frog and ar abl to continu long under water where thei often take fish which the femal carri home to their young and upon thi occas i hope the reader will pardon my relat an odd adventur be on dai abroad with my protector the sorrel nag and the weather exceed hot i entreat him to let me bath in a river that wa near he consent and i immedi strip myself stark nake and went down softli into the stream it happen that a young femal yahoo stand behind a bank saw the whole proceed and inflam by desir as the nag and i conjectur came run with all speed and leap into the water within five yard of the place where i bath i wa never in my life so terribl frighten the nag wa graze at some distanc not suspect ani harm she embrac me after a most fulsom manner i roar as loud as i could and the nag came gallop toward me whereupon she quit her grasp with the utmost reluct and leap upon the opposit bank where she stood gaze and howl all the time i wa put on my cloth thi wa a matter of divers to my master and hi famili as well as of mortif to myself for now i could no longer deni that i wa a real yahoo in everi limb and featur sinc the femal had a natur propens to me as on of their own speci neither wa the hair of thi brute of a red colour which might have been some excus for an appetit a littl irregular but black as a sloe and her counten did not make an appear altogeth so hideou as the rest of her kind for i think she could not be abov eleven year old have live three year in thi countri the reader i suppos will expect that i should like other travel give him some account of the manner and custom of it inhabit which it wa inde my princip studi to learn as these nobl houyhnhnm ar endow by natur with a gener disposit to all virtu and have no concept or idea of what is evil in a ration creatur so their grand maxim is to cultiv reason and to be wholli govern by it neither is reason among them a point problemat as with us where men can argu with plausibl on both side of the question but strike you with immedi convict as it must need do where it is not mingl obscur or discolour by passion and interest i rememb it wa with extrem difficulti that i could bring my master to understand the mean of the word opinion or how a point could be disput becaus reason taught us to affirm or deni onli where we ar certain and beyond our knowledg we cannot do either so that controversi wrangl disput and posit in fals or dubiou proposit ar evil unknown among the houyhnhnm in the like manner when i us to explain to him our sever system of natur philosophi he would laugh that a creatur pretend to reason should valu itself upon the knowledg of other peopl s conjectur and in thing where that knowledg if it were certain could be of no us wherein he agre entir with the sentiment of socrat as plato deliv them which i mention as the highest honour i can do that princ of philosoph i have often sinc reflect what destruct such doctrin would make in the librari of europ and how mani path of fame would be then shut up in the learn world friendship and benevol ar the two princip virtu among the houyhnhnm and these not confin to particular object but univers to the whole race for a stranger from the remotest part is equal treat with the nearest neighbour and wherev he goe look upon himself as at home thei preserv decenc and civil in the highest degre but ar altogeth ignor of ceremoni thei have no fond for their colt or foal but the care thei take in educ them proce entir from the dictat of reason and i observ my master to show the same affect to hi neighbour s issu that he had for hi own thei will have it that natur teach them to love the whole speci and it is reason onli that make a distinct of person where there is a superior degre of virtu when the matron houyhnhnm have produc on of each sex thei no longer accompani with their consort except thei lose on of their issu by some casualti which veri seldom happen but in such a case thei meet again or when the like accid befal a person whose wife is past bear some other coupl bestow on him on of their own colt and then go togeth again until the mother is pregnant thi caution is necessari to prevent the countri from be overburden with number but the race of inferior houyhnhnm bred up to be servant is not so strictli limit upon thi articl these ar allow to produc three of each sex to be domest in the nobl famili in their marriag thei ar exactli care to choos such colour as will not make ani disagre mixtur in the breed strength is chiefli valu in the male and comeli in the femal not upon the account of love but to preserv the race from degener for where a femal happen to excel in strength a consort is chosen with regard to comeli courtship love present jointur settlement have no place in their thought or term wherebi to express them in their languag the young coupl meet and ar join mere becaus it is the determin of their parent and friend it is what thei see done everi dai and thei look upon it as on of the necessari action of a reason be but the violat of marriag or ani other unchast wa never heard of and the marri pair pass their live with the same friendship and mutual benevol that thei bear to all other of the same speci who come in their wai without jealousi fond quarrel or discont in educ the youth of both sex their method is admir and highli deserv our imit these ar not suffer to tast a grain of oat except upon certain dai till eighteen year old nor milk but veri rare and in summer thei graze two hour in the morn and as mani in the even which their parent likewis observ but the servant ar not allow abov half that time and a great part of their grass is brought home which thei eat at the most conveni hour when thei can be best spare from work temper industri exercis and cleanli ar the lesson equal enjoin to the young on of both sex and my master thought it monstrou in us to give the femal a differ kind of educ from the male except in some articl of domest manag wherebi as he truli observ on half of our nativ were good for noth but bring children into the world and to trust the care of our children to such useless anim he said wa yet a greater instanc of brutal but the houyhnhnm train up their youth to strength speed and hardi by exercis them in run race up and down steep hill and over hard stoni ground and when thei ar all in a sweat thei ar order to leap over head and ear into a pond or river four time a year the youth of a certain district meet to show their profici in run and leap and other feat of strength and agil where the victor is reward with a song in hi or her prais on thi festiv the servant drive a herd of

determin what famili in the district shall breed anoth to suppli the loss chapter ix a grand debat at the gener assembl of the houyhnhnm and how it wa determin the learn of the houyhnhnm their build their manner of burial the defect of their languag on of these grand assembl wa held in my time about three month befor my departur whither my master went as the repres of our district in thi council wa resum their old debat and inde the onli debat that ever happen in their countri whereof my master after hi return give me a veri particular account the question to be debat wa whether the yahoo should be extermin from the face of the earth on of the member for the affirm offer sever argument of great strength and weight alleg that as the yahoo were the most filthi noisom and deform anim which natur ever produc so thei were the most restiv and indoc mischiev and malici thei would privat suck the teat of the houyhnhnm cow kill and devour their cat trampl down their oat and grass if thei were not continu watch and commit a thousand other extravag he took notic of a gener tradit that yahoo had not been alwai in their countri but that mani ag ago two of these brute appear togeth upon a mountain whether produc by the heat of the sun upon corrupt mud and slime or from the ooz and froth of the sea wa never known that these yahoo engend and their brood in a short time grew so numer as to overrun and infest the whole nation that the houyhnhnm to get rid of thi evil made a gener hunt and at last enclos the whole herd and destroi the elder everi houyhnhnm kept two young on in a kennel and brought them to such a degre of tame as an anim so savag by natur can be capabl of acquir us them for draught and carriag that there seem to be much truth in thi tradit and that those creatur could not be yinhniamshi or aborigin of the land becaus of the violent hatr the houyhnhnm as well as all other anim bore them which although their evil disposit suffici deserv could never have arriv at so high a degre if thei had been aborigin or els thei would have long sinc been root out that the inhabit take a fanci to us the servic of the yahoo had veri imprud neglect to cultiv the breed of ass which ar a come anim easili kept more tame and orderli without ani offens smell strong enough for labour although thei yield to the other in agil of bodi and if their brai be no agreeabl sound it is far prefer to the horribl howl of the yahoo sever other declar their sentiment to the same purpos when my master propos an expedi to the assembl whereof he had inde borrow the hint from me he approv of the tradit mention by the honour member who spoke befor and affirm that the two yahoo said to be seen first among them had been driven thither over the sea that come to land and be forsaken by their companion thei retir to the mountain and degener by degre becam in process of time much more savag than those of their own speci in the countri whenc these two origin came the reason of thi assert wa that he had now in hi possess a certain wonder yahoo mean myself which most of them had heard of and mani of them had seen he then relat to them how he first found me that my bodi wa all cover with an artifici composur of the skin and hair of other anim that i spoke in a languag of my own and had thoroughli learn their that i had relat to him the accid which brought me thither that when he saw me without my cover i wa an exact yahoo in everi part onli of a whiter colour less hairi and with shorter claw he ad how i had endeavour to persuad him that in my own and other countri the yahoo act as the govern ration anim and held the houyhnhnm in servitud that he observ in me all the qualiti of a yahoo onli a littl more civil by some tinctur of reason which howev wa in a degre as far inferior to the houyhnhnm race as the yahoo of their countri were to me that among other thing i mention a custom we had of castrat houyhnhnm when thei were young in order to render them tame that the oper wa easi and safe that it wa no shame to learn wisdom from brute as industri is taught by the ant and build by the swallow for so i translat the word lyhannh although it be a much larger fowl that thi invent might be practis upon the younger yahoo here which besid render them tractabl and fitter for us would in an ag put an end to the whole speci without destroi life that in the mean time the houyhnhnm should be exhort to cultiv the breed of ass which as thei ar in all respect more valuabl brute so thei have thi advantag to be fit for servic at five year old which the other ar not till twelv thi wa all my master thought fit to tell me at that time of what pass in the grand council but he wa pleas to conceal on particular which relat person to myself whereof i soon felt the unhappi effect as the reader will know in it proper place and whenc i date all the succeed misfortun of my life the houyhnhnm have no letter and consequ their knowledg is all tradit but there

both he and hi compani would often descend to ask me question and receiv my answer i had also sometim the honour of attend my master in hi visit to other i never presum to speak except in answer to a question and then i did it with inward regret becaus it wa a loss of so much time for improv myself but i wa infinit delight with the station of an humbl auditor in such convers where noth pass but what wa us express in the fewest and most signific word where as i have alreadi said the greatest decenc wa observ without the least degre of ceremoni where no person spoke without be pleas himself and pleas hi companion where there wa no interrupt tedious heat or differ of sentiment thei have a notion that when peopl ar met togeth a short silenc doe much improv convers thi i found to be true for dure those littl intermiss of talk new idea would aris in their mind which veri much enliven the discours their subject ar gener on friendship and benevol on order and economi sometim upon the visibl oper of natur or ancient tradit upon the bound and limit of virtu upon the uner rule of reason or upon some determin to be taken at the next great assembl and often upon the variou excel of poetri i mai add without vaniti that my presenc often gave them suffici matter for discours becaus it afford my master an occas of let hi friend into the histori of me and my countri upon which thei were all pleas to descant in a manner not veri advantag to humankind and for that reason i shall not repeat what thei said onli i mai be allow to observ that hi honour to my great admir appear to understand the natur of yahoo much better than myself he went through all our vice and folli and discov mani which i had never mention to him by onli suppos what qualiti a yahoo of their countri with a small proport of reason might be capabl of exert and conclud with too much probabl how vile as well as miser such a creatur must be i freeli confess that all the littl knowledg i have of ani valu wa acquir by the lectur i receiv from my master and from hear the discours of him and hi friend to which i should be prouder to listen than to dictat to the greatest and wisest assembl in europ i admir the strength comeli and speed of the inhabit and such a constel of virtu in such amiabl person produc in me the highest vener at first inde i did not feel that natur aw which the yahoo and all other anim bear toward them but it grew upon me by decre much sooner than i imagin and wa mingl with a respect love and gratitud that thei would condescend to distinguish me from the rest of my speci when i thought of my famili my friend my countrymen or the human race in gener i consid them as thei realli were yahoo in shape and disposit perhap a littl more civil and qualifi with the gift of speech but make no other us of reason than to improv and multipli those vice whereof their brethren in thi countri had onli the share that natur allot them when i happen to behold the reflect of my own form in a lake or fountain i turn awai my face in horror and detest of myself and could better endur the sight of a common yahoo than of my own person by convers with the houyhnhnm and look upon them with delight i fell to imit their gait and gestur which is now grown into a habit and my friend often tell me in a blunt wai that i trot like a hors which howev i take for a great compliment neither shall i disown that in speak i am apt to fall into the voic and manner of the houyhnhnm and hear myself ridicul on that account without the least mortif in the midst of all thi happi and when i look upon myself to be fulli settl for life my master sent for me on morn a littl earlier than hi usual hour i observ by hi counten that he wa in some perplex and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak after a short silenc he told me he did not know how i would take what he wa go to sai that in the last gener assembl when the affair of the yahoo wa enter upon the repres had taken offenc at hi keep a yahoo mean myself in hi famili more like a houyhnhnm than a brute anim that he wa known frequent to convers with me as if he could receiv some advantag or pleasur in my compani that such a practic wa not agreeabl to reason or natur or a thing ever heard of befor among them the assembl did therefor exhort him either to emploi me like the rest of my speci or command me to swim back to the place whenc i came that the first of these expedi wa utterli reject by all the houyhnhnm who had ever seen me at hi hous or their own for thei alleg that becaus i had some rudiment of reason ad to the natur praviti of those anim it wa to be fear i might be abl to seduc them into the woodi and mountain part of the countri and bring them in troop by night to destroi the houyhnhnm cattl as be natur of the raven kind and avers from labour my master ad that he wa daili press by the houyhnhnm of the neighbourhood to have the assembl s exhort execut which he could not put off much longer he doubt it would be imposs for me to swim to anoth countri and therefor wish i would contriv some sort of vehicl resembl those i had describ to him that might carri me on the sea in which work i should have the assist of hi own servant as well as those of hi neighbour he conclud that for hi own part he could have been content to keep me in hi servic as long as i live becaus he found i had cure myself of some bad habit and disposit by endeavour as far as my inferior natur wa capabl to imit the houyhnhnm i should here observ to the reader that a decre of the gener assembl in thi countri is express by the word hnhloayn which signifi an exhort as near as i can render it for thei have no concept how a ration creatur can be compel but onli advis or exhort becaus no person can disobei reason without give up hi claim to be a ration creatur i wa struck with the utmost grief and despair at my master s discours and be unabl to support the agoni i wa under i fell into a swoon at hi feet when i came to myself he told me that he conclud i had been dead for these peopl ar subject to no such imbecil of natur i answer in a faint voic that death would have been too great a happi that although i could not blame the assembl s exhort or the urgenc of hi friend yet in my weak and corrupt judgment i thought it might consist with reason to have been less rigor that i could not swim a leagu and probabl the nearest land to their might be distant abov a hundr that mani materi necessari for make a small vessel to carri me off were wholli want in thi countri which howev i would attempt in obedi and gratitud to hi honour although i conclud the thing to be imposs and therefor look on myself as alreadi devot to destruct that the certain prospect of an unnatur death wa the least of my evil for suppos i should escap with life by some strang adventur how could i think with temper of pass my dai among yahoo and relaps into my old corrupt for want of exampl to lead and keep me within the path of virtu that i knew too well upon what solid reason all the determin of the wise houyhnhnm were found not to be shaken by argument of mine a miser yahoo and therefor after present him with my humbl thank for the offer of hi servant assist in make a vessel and desir a reason time for so difficult a work i told him i would endeavour to preserv a wretch be and if ever i return to england wa not without hope of be us to my own speci by celebr the prais of the renown houyhnhnm and propos their virtu to the imit of mankind my master in a few word made me a veri graciou repli allow me the space of two month to finish my boat and order the sorrel nag my fellow servant for so at thi distanc i mai presum to call him to follow my instruct becaus i told my master that hi help would be suffici and i knew he had a tender for me in hi compani my first busi wa to go to that part of the coast where my rebelli crew had order me to be set on shore i got upon a height and look on everi side into the sea fanci i saw a small island toward the north east i took out my pocket glass and could then clearli distinguish it abov five leagu off as i comput but it appear to the sorrel nag to be onli a blue cloud for as he had no concept of ani countri besid hi own so he could not be as expert in distinguish remot object at sea as we who so much convers in that element after i had discov thi island i consid no further but resolv it should if possibl be the first place of my banish leav the consequ to fortun i return home and consult with the sorrel nag we went into a cops at some distanc where i with my knife and he with a sharp flint fasten veri artifici after their manner to a wooden handl cut down sever oak wattl about the thick of a walk staff and some larger piec but i shall not troubl the reader with a particular descript of my own mechan let it suffic to sai that in six week time with the help of the sorrel nag who perform the part that requir most labour i finish a sort of indian cano but much larger cover it with the skin of yahoo well stitch togeth with hempen thread of my own make my sail wa likewis compos of the skin of the same anim but i made us of the youngest i could get the older be too tough and thick and i likewis provid myself with four paddl i laid in a stock of boil flesh of rabbit and fowl and took with me two vessel on fill with milk and the other with water i tri my cano in a larg pond near my master s hous and then correct in it what wa amiss stop all the chink with yahoo tallow till i found it staunch and abl to bear me and my freight and when it wa as complet as i could possibl make it i had it drawn on a carriag veri gentli by yahoo to the sea side under the conduct of the sorrel nag and anoth servant when all wa readi and the dai came for my departur i took leav of my master and ladi and the whole famili my ey flow with tear and my heart quit sunk with grief but hi honour out of curios and perhap if i mai speak without vaniti partli out of kind wa

intend to steer my cours i took a second leav of my master but as i wa go to prostrat myself to kiss hi hoof he did me the honour to rais it gentli to my mouth i am not ignor how much i have been censur for mention thi last particular detractor ar pleas to think it improb that so illustri a person should descend to give so great a mark of distinct to a creatur so inferior as i neither have i forgotten how apt some travel ar to boast of extraordinari favour thei have receiv but if these censur were better acquaint with the nobl and courteou disposit of the houyhnhnm thei would soon chang

with the help of the tide i went at the rate of a leagu and a half an hour as near as i could guess my master and hi friend continu on the shore till i wa almost out of sight and i often heard the sorrel nag who alwai love me cry out hnui illa nyha majah yahoo take care of thyself gentl yahoo my design wa if possibl to discov some small island uninhabit yet suffici by my labour to furnish me with the necessari of life which i would have thought a greater happi than to be first minist in the politest court of europ so horribl wa the idea i conceiv of return to live in the societi and under the govern of yahoo for in such a solitud as i desir i could at least enjoi my own thought and reflect with delight on the virtu of those inimit houyhnhnm without an opportun of degener into the vice and corrupt of my own speci the reader mai rememb what i relat when my crew conspir against me and confin me to my cabin how i continu there sever week without know what cours we took and when i wa put ashor in the long boat how the sailor told me with oath whether true or fals that thei knew not in what part of the world we were howev i did then believ us to be about degre southward of the cape

better than conjectur yet i resolv to steer my cours eastward hope to reach the south west coast of new holland and perhap some such island as i desir ly westward of it the wind wa full west and by six in the even i comput i had gone eastward at least eighteen leagu when i spi a veri small island about half a leagu off which i soon reach it wa noth but a rock with on creek natur arch by the forc of tempest here i put in my cano and climb a part of the rock i could plainli discov land to the east extend from south to north i lai all night in my cano and repeat my voyag earli in the morn i arriv in seven hour to the south east point of new holland thi confirm me in the opinion i have long entertain that the map and chart place thi countri at least three degre more to the east than it realli is which thought i commun mani year ago to my worthi friend mr herman moll and gave him my reason for it although he ha rather chosen to follow other author i saw no inhabit in the place where i land and be unarm i wa afraid of ventur far into the countri i found some shellfish on the shore and at them raw not dare to kindl a fire for fear of be discov by the nativ i continu three dai feed on oyster and limpet to save my own provis and i fortun found a brook of excel water which gave me great relief on the fourth dai ventur out earli a littl too far i saw twenti or thirti nativ upon a height not abov five hundr yard from me thei were stark nake men women and children round a fire as i could discov by the smoke on of them spi me and gave notic to the rest five of them advanc toward me leav the women and children at the fire i made what hast i could to the shore and get into my cano shove off the savag observ me retreat ran after me and befor i could get far enough into the sea discharg an arrow which wound me deepli on the insid of my left knee i shall carri the mark to my grave i apprehend the arrow might be poison and paddl out of the reach of their dart be a calm dai i made a shift to suck the wound and dress it as well as i could i wa at a loss what to do for i durst not return to the same land place but stood to the north and wa forc to paddl for the wind though veri gentl wa against me blow north west as i wa look about for a secur land place i saw a sail to the north north east which appear everi minut more visibl i wa in some doubt whether i should wait for them or not but at last my detest of the yahoo race prevail and turn my cano i sail and paddl togeth to the south and got into the same creek whenc i set out in the morn choos rather to trust myself among these barbarian than live with european yahoo i drew up my cano as close as i could to the shore and hid myself behind a stone by the littl brook which as i have alreadi said wa excel water the ship came within half a leagu of thi creek and sent her long boat with vessel to take in fresh water for the place it seem wa veri well known but i did not observ it till the boat wa almost on shore and it wa too late to seek anoth hide place the seamen at their land observ my cano and rummag it all over easili conjectur that the owner could not be far off four of them well arm search everi cranni and lurk hole till at last thei found me flat on my face behind the stone thei gaze awhil in admir at my strang uncouth dress my coat made of skin my wooden sole shoe and my fur stock whenc howev thei conclud i wa not a nativ of the place who all go nake on of the seamen in portugues bid me rise and ask who i wa i understood that languag veri well and get upon my feet said i wa a poor yahoo banish from the houyhnhnm and desir thei would pleas to let me depart thei admir to hear me answer them in their own tongu and saw by my complexion i must be a european but were at a loss to know what i meant by yahoo and houyhnhnm and at the same time fell a laugh at my strang tone in speak which resembl the neigh of a hors i trembl all the while betwixt fear and hatr i again desir leav to depart and wa gentli move to my cano but thei laid hold of me desir to know what countri i wa of whenc i came with mani other question i told them i wa born in england whenc i came about five year ago and then their countri and our were at peac i therefor hope thei would not treat me as an enemi sinc i meant them no harm but wa a poor yahoo seek some desol place where to pass the remaind of hi unfortun life when thei began to talk i thought i never heard or saw ani thing more unnatur for it appear to me as monstrou as if a dog or a cow should speak in england or a yahoo in houyhnhnmland the honest portugues were equal amaz at my strang dress and the odd manner of deliv my word which howev thei understood veri well thei spoke to me with great human and said thei were sure the captain would carri me grati to lisbon whenc i might return to my own countri that two of the seamen would go back to the ship inform the captain of what thei had seen and receiv hi order in the mean time unless i would give my solemn oath not to fly thei would secur me by forc i thought it best to compli with their propos thei were veri curiou to know my stori but i gave them veri littl satisfact and thei all conjectur that my misfortun had impair my reason in two hour the boat which went laden with vessel of water return with the captain s command to fetch me on board i fell on my knee to preserv my liberti but all wa in vain and the men have ti me with cord heav me into the boat whenc i wa taken into the ship and thenc into the captain s cabin hi name wa pedro de mendez he wa a veri courteou and gener person he entreat me to give some account of myself and desir to know what i would eat or drink said i should be us as well as himself and spoke so mani oblig thing that i wonder to find such civil from a yahoo howev i remain silent and sullen i wa readi to faint at the veri smell of him and hi men at last i desir someth to eat out of my own cano but he order me a chicken and some excel wine and then direct that i should be put to bed in a veri clean cabin i would not undress myself but lai on the bed cloth and in half an hour stole out when i thought the crew wa at dinner and get to the side of the ship wa go to leap into the sea and swim for my life rather than continu among yahoo but on of the seamen prevent me and have inform the captain i wa chain to my cabin after dinner don pedro came to me and desir to know my reason for so desper an attempt assur me he onli meant to do me all the servic he wa abl and spoke so veri movingli that at last i descend to treat him like an anim which had some littl portion of reason i gave him a veri short relat of my voyag of the conspiraci against me by my own men of the countri where thei set me on shore and of my five year resid there all which he look upon as if it were a dream or a vision whereat i took great offenc for i had quit forgot the faculti of ly so peculiar to yahoo in all countri where thei presid and consequ their disposit of suspect truth in other of their own speci i ask him whether it were the custom in hi countri to sai the thing which wa not i assur him i had almost forgot what he meant by falsehood and if i had live a thousand year in houyhnhnmland i should never have heard a lie from the meanest servant that i wa altogeth indiffer whether he believ me or not but howev in return for hi favour i would give so much allow to the corrupt of hi natur as to answer ani object he would pleas to make and then he might easili discov the truth the captain a wise man after mani endeavour to catch me trip in some part of my stori at last began to have a better opinion of my verac but he ad that sinc i profess so inviol an attach to truth i must give him my word and honour to bear him compani in thi voyag without attempt ani thing against my life or els he would continu me a prison till we arriv at lisbon i gave him the promis he requir but at the same time protest that i would suffer the greatest hardship rather than return to live among yahoo our voyag pass without ani consider accid in gratitud to the captain i sometim sat with him at hi earnest request and strove to conceal my antipathi against human kind although it often broke out which he suffer to pass without observ but the greatest part of the dai i confin myself to my cabin to avoid see ani of the crew the captain had often entreat me to strip myself of my savag dress and offer to lend me the best suit of cloth he had thi i would not be prevail on to accept abhor to cover myself with ani thing that had been on the back of a yahoo i onli desir he would lend me two clean shirt which have been wash sinc he wore them i believ would not so much defil me these i chang everi second dai and wash them myself we arriv at lisbon nov at our land the captain forc me to cover myself with hi cloak to prevent the rabbl from crowd about me i wa convei to hi own hous and at my earnest request he led me up to the highest room backward i conjur him to conceal from all person what i had told him of the houyhnhnm becaus the least hint of such a stori would not onli draw number of peopl to see me but probabl put me in danger of be imprison or burnt by the inquisit the captain persuad me to accept a suit of cloth newli made but i would not suffer the tailor to take my measur howev don pedro be almost of my size thei fit me well enough he accoutr me with other necessari all new which i air for twenti four hour befor i would us them the captain had no wife nor abov three servant none of which were suffer to attend at meal and hi whole deport wa so oblig ad to veri good human understand that i realli began to toler hi compani he gain so far upon me that i ventur to look out of the back window by degre i wa brought into anoth room whenc i peep into the street but drew my head back in a fright in a week s time he seduc me down to the door i found my terror gradual lessen but my hatr and contempt seem to increas i wa at last bold enough to walk the street in hi compani but kept my nose well stop with rue or sometim with tobacco in ten dai don pedro to whom i had given some account of my domest affair put it upon me as a matter of honour and conscienc that i ought to return to my nativ countri and live at home with my wife and children he told me there wa an english ship in the port just readi to sail and he would furnish me with all thing necessari it would be tediou to repeat hi argument and my contradict he said it wa altogeth imposs to find such a solitari island as i desir to live in but i might command in my own hous and pass my time in a manner as reclus as i pleas i compli at last find i could not do better i left lisbon the th dai of novemb in an english merchantman but who wa the master i never inquir don pedro accompani me to the ship and lent me twenti pound he took kind leav of me and embrac me at part which i bore as well as i could dure thi last voyag i had no commerc with the master or ani of hi men but pretend i wa sick kept close in my cabin on the fifth of decemb we cast anchor in the down about nine in the morn and at three in the

with hatr disgust and contempt and the more by reflect on the near allianc i had to them for although sinc my unfortun exil from the houyhnhnm countri i had compel myself to toler the sight of yahoo
