so broad ar the evid of it histor worthless that it is scarc necessari to point them out in detail let us now consid some of the opinion to which a persev patient and learn but by no mean consist seri of investig ha led in do so i profess to bring forward statement not to vouch for their reason or probabl homer appear the histori of thi poet and hi work is lost in doubt obscur as is the histori of mani of the first mind who have done honour to human becaus thei rose amidst dark the majest stream of hi song bless and fertil flow like the nile through mani land and nation and like the sourc of the nile it fountain will ever remain conceal such ar the word in which on of the most judici german critic ha eloqu describ the uncertainti in which the whole of the homer question is involv with no less truth and feel he proce it seem here of chief import to expect no more than the natur of thing make possibl if the period of tradit in histori is the region of twilight we should not expect in it perfect light the creation of geniu alwai seem like miracl becaus thei ar for the most part creat far out of the reach of observ if we were in possess of all the histor testimoni we never could wholli explain the origin of the iliad and the odyssei for their origin in all essenti point must have remain the secret of the poet from thi critic which show as much insight into the depth of human natur as into the minut wire draw of scholast investig let us pass on to the main question at issu wa homer an individu or were the iliad and odyssei the result of an ingeni arrang of fragment by earlier poet well ha landor remark some tell us there were twenti homer some deni that there wa ever on it were idl and foolish to shake the content of a vase in order to let them settl at last we ar perpetu labour to destroi our delight our composur our devot to superior power of all the anim on earth we least know what is good for us my opinion is that what is best for us is our admir of good no man live vener homer more than i do but greatli as we admir the gener enthusiasm which rest content with the poetri on which it best impuls had been nurtur and foster without seek to destroi the vivid of first impress by minut analysi our editori offic compel us to give some attent to the doubt and difficulti with which the homer question is beset and to entreat our reader for a brief period to prefer hi judgment to hi imagin and to condescend to dry detail befor howev enter into particular respect the question of thi uniti of the homer poem at least of the iliad i must express my sympathi with the sentiment express in the follow remark we cannot but think the univers admir of it uniti by the better the poetic ag of greec almost conclus testimoni to it origin composit it wa not till the ag of the grammarian that it primit integr wa call in question nor is it injustic to assert that the minut and analyt spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualif for the profound feel the comprehens concept of an harmoni whole the most exquisit anatomist mai be no judg of the symmetri of the human frame and we would take the opinion of chantrei or westmacott on the proport and gener beauti of a

longinu in an oft quot passag mere express an opinion touch the compar inferior of the odyssei to the iliad and among a mass of ancient author whose veri name it would be tediou to detail no suspicion of the person non exist of homer ever aros so far the voic of antiqu seem to be in favour of our earli idea on the subject let us now see what ar the discoveri to which more modern investig lai claim at the end of the seventeenth centuri doubt had begun to awaken on the subject and we find bentlei remark that homer wrote a sequel of song and rhapsodi to be sung by himself for small come and good cheer at festiv and other dai of merriment these loos song were not collect togeth in the form of an epic poem till about peisistratu time about five hundr year after two french writer hedelin and perrault avow a similar sceptic on the subject but it is in the scienza nuova of battista vico that we first meet with the germ of the theori subsequ defend by wolf with so much learn and acut inde it is with the wolfian theori that we have chiefli to deal and with the follow bold hypothesi which we will detail in the word of grote half a centuri ago the acut and valuabl prolegomena of f a wolf turn to account the venetian scholia which had then been recent publish first open philosoph discuss as to the histori of the homer text a consider part of that dissert though by no mean the whole is emploi in vindic the posit previous announc by bentlei amongst other that the separ constitu portion of the iliad and odyssei had not been cement togeth into ani compact bodi and unchang order until the dai of peisistratu in the sixth centuri befor christ as a step toward that conclus wolf maintain that no written copi of either poem could be shown to have exist dure the earlier time to which their composit is refer and that without write neither the perfect symmetri of so complic a work could have been origin conceiv by ani poet nor if realiz by him transmit with assur to poster the absenc of easi and conveni write such as must be indispens suppos for long manuscript among the earli greek wa thu on of the point in wolf s case against the primit integr of the iliad and odyssei by nitzsch and other lead oppon of wolf the connect of the on with the other seem to have been accept as he origin put it and it ha been consid incumb on those who defend the ancient aggreg charact of the iliad and odyssei to maintain that thei were written poem from the begin to me it appear that the architecton function ascrib by wolf to peisistratu and hi associ in refer to the homer poem ar nowis admiss but much would undoubtedli be gain toward that view of the question if it could be shown that in order to controvert it we were driven to the necess of admit long written poem in the ninth centuri befor the christian aera few thing in my opinion can be more improb and mr payn knight oppos as he is to the wolfian hypothesi admit thi no less than wolf himself the trace of write in greec even in the seventh centuri befor the christian aera ar exceedingli trifl we have no remain inscript earlier than the fortieth olympiad and the earli inscript ar rude and unskilfulli execut nor can we even assur ourselv whether archilochu simonid of amorgu kallinu tyrtaeu xanthu and the other earli elegiac and lyric poet commit their composit to write or at what time the practic of do so becam familiar the first posit ground which author us to presum the exist of a manuscript of homer is in the famou ordin of solon with regard to the rhapsodi at the panathenaea but for what length of time previous manuscript had exist we ar unabl to sai those who maintain the homer poem to have been written from the begin rest their case not upon posit proof nor yet upon the exist habit of societi with regard to poetri for thei admit gener that the iliad and odyssei were not read but recit and heard but upon the suppos necess that there must have been manuscript to ensur the preserv of the poem the unassist memori of recit be neither suffici nor trustworthi but here we onli escap a smaller difficulti by run into a greater for the exist of train bard gift with extraordinari memori is far less astonish than that of long manuscript in an ag essenti non read and non write and when even suitabl instrument and materi for the process ar not obviou moreov there is a strong posit reason for believ that the bard wa under no necess of refresh hi memori by consult a manuscript for if such had been the fact blind would have been a disqualif for the profess which we know that it wa not as well from the exampl of demodoku in the odyssei as from that of the blind bard of chio in the hymn to the delian apollo whom thucydid as well as the gener tenor of grecian legend identifi with homer himself the author of that hymn be he who he mai could never have describ a blind man as attain the utmost perfect in hi art if he had been consciou that the memori of the bard wa onli maintain by constant refer to the manuscript in hi chest the loss of the digamma that crux of critic that quicksand upon which even the acumen of bentlei wa shipwreck seem to prove beyond a doubt that the pronunci of the greek languag had undergon a consider chang now it is certainli difficult to suppos that the homer poem could have suffer by thi chang had written copi been preserv if chaucer s poetri for instanc had not been written it could onli have come down to us in a soften form more like the effemin version of dryden than the rough quaint nobl origin at what period continu grote these poem or inde ani other greek poem first began to be written must be matter of conjectur though there is ground for assur that it wa befor the time of solon if in the absenc of evid we mai ventur upon name ani more determin period the question a onc suggest itself what were the purpos which in that state of societi a manuscript at it first commenc must have been intend to answer for whom wa a written iliad necessari not for the rhapsod for with them it wa not onli plant in the memori but also interwoven with the feel and conceiv in conjunct with all those flexion and inton of voic paus and other oral artific which were requir for emphat deliveri and which the nake manuscript could never reproduc not for the gener public thei were accustom to receiv it with it rhapsod deliveri and with it accompani of a solemn and crowd festiv the onli person for whom the written iliad would be suitabl would be a select few studiou and curiou men a class of reader capabl of analyz the complic emot which thei had experienc as hearer in the crowd and who would on perus the written word realiz in their imagin a sensibl portion of the impress commun by the recit incred as the statement mai seem in an ag like the present there is in all earli societi and there wa in earli greec a time when no such read class exist if we could discov at what time such a class first began to be form we should be abl to make a guess at the time when the old epic poem were first commit to write now the period which mai with the greatest probabl be fix upon as have first wit the format even of the narrowest read class in greec is the middl of the seventh centuri befor the christian aera b c to b c the ag of terpand kallinu archilochu simonid of amorgu c i ground thi supposit on the chang then oper in the charact and tendenc of grecian poetri and music the elegiac and the iambic measur have been introduc as rival to the primit hexamet and poetic composit have been transfer from the epic past to the affair of present and real life such a chang wa import at a time when poetri wa the onli known mode of public to us a modern phrase not altogeth suitabl yet the nearest approach to the sens it argu a new wai of look at the old epic treasur of the peopl as well as a thirst for new poetic effect and the men who stood forward in it mai well be consid as desir to studi and compet to critic from their own individu point of view the written word of the homer rhapsodi just as we ar told that kallinu both notic and eulog the thebai as the product of homer there seem therefor ground for conjectur that for the us of thi newli form and import but veri narrow class manuscript of the homer poem and other old epic the thebai and the cypria as well as the iliad and the odyssei began to be compil toward the middl of the seventh centuri b c and the open of egypt to grecian commerc which took place about the same period would furnish increas facil for obtain the requisit papyru to write upon a read class when onc form would doubtless slowli increas and the number of manuscript along with it so that befor the time of solon fifti year afterward both reader and manuscript though still compar few might have attain a certain recogn author and form a tribun of refer against the careless of individu rhapsod but even peisistratu ha not been suffer to remain in possess of the credit and we cannot help feel the forc of the follow observ there ar sever incident circumst which in our opinion throw some suspicion over the whole histori of the peisistratid compil at least over the theori that the iliad wa cast into it present state and harmoni form by the direct of the athenian ruler if the great poet who flourish at the bright period of grecian song of which ala we have inherit littl more than the fame and the faint echo if stesichoru anacreon and simonid were emploi in the nobl task of compil the iliad and odyssei so much must have been done to arrang to connect to harmon that it is almost incred that stronger mark of athenian manufactur should not remain whatev occasion anomali mai be detect anomali which no doubt aris out of our own ignor of the languag of the homer ag howev the irregular us of the digamma mai have perplex our bentlei to whom the name of helen is said to have caus as much disquiet and distress as the fair on herself among the hero of her ag howev mr knight mai have fail in reduc the homer languag to it primit form howev final the attic dialect mai not have assum all it more mark and distinguish characterist still it is difficult to suppos that the languag particularli in the join and transit and connect part should not more clearli betrai the incongru between the more ancient and modern form of express it is not quit in charact with such a period to imit an antiqu style in order to piec out an imperfect poem in the charact of the origin as sir walter scott ha done in hi continu of sir tristram if howev not even such faint and indistinct trace of athenian compil ar discover in the languag of the poem the total absenc of athenian nation feel is perhap no less worthi of observ in later and it mai fairli be suspect in earlier time the athenian were more than ordinarili jealou of the fame of their ancestor but amid all the tradit of the glori of earli greec embodi in the iliad the athenian plai a most subordin and insignific part even the few passag which relat to their ancestor mr knight suspect to be interpol it is possibl inde that in it lead outlin the iliad mai be true to histor fact that in the great maritim expedit of western greec against the rival and half kindr empir of the laomedontiada the chieftain of thessali from hi valour and the number of hi forc mai have been the most import alli of the peloponnesian sovereign the preemin valu of the ancient poetri on the trojan war mai thu have forc the nation feel of the athenian to yield to their tast the song which spoke of their own great ancestor were no doubt of far inferior sublim and popular or at first sight a theseid would have been much more like to have eman from an athenian synod of compil of ancient song than an achilleid or an olysseid could franc have given birth to a tasso tancr would have been the hero of the jerusalem if howev the homer ballad as thei ar sometim call which relat the wrath of achil with all it dire consequ were so far superior to the rest of the poetic cycl as to admit no rivalri it is still surpris that throughout the whole poem the callida junctura should never betrai the workmanship of an athenian hand and that the nation spirit of a race who have at a later period not inaptli been compar to our self admir neighbour the french should submit with lofti self denial to the almost total exclus of their own ancestor or at least to the question digniti of onli have produc a leader toler skill in the militari tactic of hi ag to return to the wolfian theori while it is to be confess that wolf s object to the primit integr of the iliad and odyssei have never been wholli got over we cannot help discov that thei have fail to enlighten us as to ani substanti point and that the difficulti with which the whole subject is beset ar rather augment than otherwis if we admit hi hypothesi nor is lachmann s modif of hi theori ani better he divid the first twenti two book of the iliad into sixteen differ song and treat as ridicul the belief that their amalgam into on regular poem belong to a period earlier than the ag of peisistratu thi as grote observ explain the gap and contradict in the narr but it explain noth els moreov we find no contradict warrant thi belief and the so call sixteen poet concur in get rid of the follow lead men in the first battl after the secess of achil elphenor chief of the euboean tlepolemu of the rhodian pandaru of the lycian odiu of the halizonian pirou and acama of the thracian none of these hero again make their appear and we can but agre with colonel mure that it seem strang that ani number of independ poet should have so harmoni dispens with the servic of all six in the sequel the discrep by which pylaemen who is repres as dead in the fifth book weep at hi son s funer in the thirteenth can onli be regard as the result of an interpol grote although not veri distinct in state hi own opinion on the subject ha done much to clearli show the incongru of the wolfian theori and of lachmann s modif with the charact of peisistratu but he ha also shown and we think with equal success that the two question rel to the primit uniti of these poem or suppos that imposs the unison of these part by peisistratu and not befor hi time ar essenti distinct in short a man mai believ the iliad to have been put togeth out of pre exist song without recognis the ag of peisistratu as the period of it first compil the friend or literari employ of peisistratu must have found an iliad that wa alreadi ancient and the silenc of the alexandrin critic respect the peisistrat recens goe far to prove that among the numer manuscript thei examin thi wa either want or thought unworthi of attent moreov he continu the whole tenor of the poem themselv confirm what is here remark there is noth either in the iliad

task of piec togeth mani self exist epic into on larg aggreg everyth in the two great homer poem both in substanc and in languag belong to an ag two or three centuri earlier than peisistratu inde even the interpol or those passag which on the best ground ar pronounc to be such betrai no trace of the sixth centuri befor christ and mai well have been heard by archilochu and kallinu in some case even by arktinu and hesiod as genuin homer matter as far as the evid on the case as well intern as extern enabl us to judg we seem warrant in believ that the iliad and odyssei were recit substanti as thei now stand alwai allow for paitial diverg of text and interpol in b c our first trustworthi mark of grecian time and thi ancient date let it be ad as it is the best authent fact so it is also the most import attribut of the homer poem consid in refer to grecian histori for thei thu afford us an insight into the anti histor charact of the greek enabl us to trace the subsequ forward march of the nation and to seiz instruct contrast between their former and their later condit on the whole i am inclin to believ that the labour of peisistratu were wholli of an editori charact although i must confess that i can lai down noth respect the extent of hi labour at the same time so far from believ that the composit or primari arrang of these poem in their present form wa the work of peisistratu i am rather persuad that the fine tast and eleg mind of that athenian would lead him to preserv an ancient and tradit order of the poem rather than to patch and re construct them accord to a fanci hypothesi i will not repeat the mani discuss respect whether the poem were written or not or whether the art of write wa known in the time of their reput author suffic it to sai that the more we read the less satisfi we ar upon either subject i cannot howev help think that the stori which attribut the preserv of these poem to lycurgu is littl els than a version of the same stori as that of peisistratu while it histor probabl must be measur by that of mani other relat to the spartan confuciu i will conclud thi sketch of the homer theori with an attempt made by an ingeni friend to unit them into someth like consist it is as follow no doubt the common soldier of that ag had like the common sailor of some fifti year ago some on qualifi to discours in excel music among them mani of these like those of the negro in the unit state were extemporan and allus to event pass around them but what wa pass around them the grand event of a spirit stir war occurr like to impress themselv as the mystic legend of former time had done upon their memori besid which a retent memori wa deem a virtu of the first water and wa cultiv accordingli in those ancient time ballad at first and down to the begin of the war with troi were mere recit with an inton then follow a speci of recit probabl with an inton burden tune next follow as it aid the memori consider it wa at thi period about four hundr year after the war that a poet flourish of the name of melesigen or moeonid but most probabl the former he saw that these ballad might be made of great util to hi purpos of write a poem on the social posit of hella and as a collect he publish these lai connect them by a tale of hi own thi poem now exist under the titl of the odyssea the author howev did not affix hi own name to the poem which in fact wa great part of it remodel from the archaic dialect of crete in which tongu the ballad were found by him he therefor call it the poem of homero or the collector but thi is rather a proof of hi modesti and talent than of hi mere drudg arrang of other peopl s idea for as grote ha fine observ argu for the uniti of authorship a great poet might have re cast pre exist separ song into on comprehens whole but no mere arrang or compil would be compet to do so while emploi on the wild legend of odysseu he met with a ballad record the quarrel of achil and agamemnon hi nobl mind seiz the hint that there present itself and the achillei grew under hi hand uniti of design howev caus him to publish the poem under the same pseudonym as hi former work and the disjoint lai of the ancient bard were join togeth like those relat to the cid into a chronicl histori name the iliad melesigen knew that the poem wa destin to be a last on and so it ha prove but first the poem were destin to undergo mani vicissitud and corrupt by the peopl who took to sing them in the street assembl and agora howev solon first and then peisistratu and afterward aristotel and other revis the poem and restor the work of melesigen homero to their origin integr in a great measur have thu given some gener notion of the strang theori which have develop themselv respect thi most interest subject i must still express my convict as to the uniti of the authorship of the homer poem to deni that mani corrupt and interpol disfigur them and that the intrus hand of the poetast mai here and there have inflict a wound more seriou than the neglig of the copyist would be an absurd and captiou assumpt but it is to a higher critic that we must appeal if we would either understand or enjoi these poem in maintain the authent and person of their on author be he homer or melesigen quocunqu nomin vocari eum ju fasqu sit i feel consciou that while the whole weight of histor evid is against the hypothesi which would assign these great work to a plural of author the most power intern evid and that which spring from the deepest and most immedi impuls of the soul also speak eloqu to the contrari the minutia of verbal critic i am far from seek to despis inde consid the charact of some of my own book such an attempt would be gross inconsist but while i appreci it import in a philolog view i am inclin to set littl store on it aesthet valu especi in poetri three part of the emend made upon poet ar mere alter some of which had thei been suggest to the author by hi maecena or africanu he would probabl have adopt moreov those who ar most exact in lai down rule of verbal critic and interpret ar often least compet to carri out their own precept grammarian ar not poet by profess but mai be so per acciden i do not at thi moment rememb two emend on homer calcul to substanti improv the poetri of a passag although a mass of remark from herodotu down to loew have given us the histori of a thousand minut point without which our greek knowledg would be gloomi and jejun but it is not on word onli that grammarian mere grammarian will exercis their elabor and often tiresom ingenu bind down an heroic or dramat poet to the block upon which thei have previous dissect hi word and sentenc thei proce to us the ax and the prune knife by wholesal and inconsist in everyth but their wish to make out a case of unlaw affili thei cut out book after book passag after passag till the author is reduc to a collect of fragment or till those who fanci thei possess the work of some great man find that thei have been put off with a vile counterfeit got up at second hand if we compar the theori of knight wolf lachmann and other we shall feel better satisfi of the utter uncertainti of critic than of the apocryph posit of homer on reject what anoth consid the turn point of hi theori on cut a suppos knot by expung what anoth would explain by omit someth els nor is thi morbid speci of sagac by ani mean to be look upon as a literari novelti justu lipsiu a scholar of no ordinari skill seem to revel in the imaginari discoveri that the tragedi attribut to seneca ar by four differ author now i will ventur to assert that these tragedi ar so uniform not onli in their borrow phraseolog a phraseolog with which writer like boethiu and saxo grammaticu were more charm than ourselv in their freedom from real poetri and last but not least in an ultra refin and consist abandon of good tast that few writer of the present dai would question the capabl of the same gentleman be he seneca or not to produc not onli these but a great mani more equal bad with equal sagac father hardouin astonish the world with the startl announc that the neid of virgil and the satir of horac were literari decept now without wish to sai on word of disrespect against the industri and learn nai the refin acut which scholar like wolf have bestow upon thi subject i must express my fear that mani of our modern homer theori will becom matter for the surpris and entertain rather than the instruct of poster nor can i help think that the literari histori of more recent time will account for mani point of difficulti in the transmiss of the iliad and odyssei to a period so remot from that of their first creation i have alreadi express my belief that the labour of peisistratu were of a pure editori charact and there seem no more reason why corrupt and imperfect edit of homer mai not have been abroad in hi dai than that the poem of valeriu flaccu and tibullu should have given so much troubl to poggio scalig and other but after all the main fault in all the homer theori is that thei demand too great a sacrific of those feel to which poetri most powerfulli appeal and which ar it most fit judg the ingenu which ha sought to rob us of the name and exist of homer doe too much violenc to that inward emot which make our whole soul yearn with love and admir for the blind bard of chio to believ the author of the iliad a mere compil is to degrad the power of human invent to elev analyt judgment at the expens of the most ennobl impuls of the soul and to forget the ocean in the contempl of a polypu there is a cathol so to speak in the veri name of homer our faith in the author of the iliad mai be a mistaken on but as yet nobodi ha taught us a better while howev i look upon the belief in homer as on that ha natur herself for it mainspr while i can join with old enniu in believ in homer as the ghost who like some patron saint hover round the bed of the poet and even bestow rare gift from that wealth of imagin which a host of imit could not exhaust still i am far from wish to deni that the author of these great poem found a rich fund of tradit a well stock mythic storehous from whenc he might deriv both subject and embellish but it is on thing to us exist romanc in the embellish of a poem anoth to patch up the poem itself from such materi what consist of style and execut can be hope for from such an attempt or rather what bad tast and tedium will not be the infal result a blend of popular legend and a free us of the song of other bard ar featur perfectli consist with poetic origin in fact the most origin writer is still draw upon outward impress nai even hi own thought ar a kind of secondari agent which support and feed the impuls of imagin but unless there be some grand pervad principl some invis yet most distinctli stamp archetypu of the great whole a poem like the iliad can never come to the birth tradit the most picturesqu episod the most pathet local associ teem with the thought of god and great men mai crowd in on mighti vision or reveal themselv in more substanti form to the mind of the poet but except the power to creat a grand whole to which these shall be but as detail and embellish be present we shall have nought but a scrap book a parterr fill with flower and weed strangl each other in their wild redund we shall have a cento of rag and tatter which will requir littl acut to detect sensibl as i am of the difficulti of disprov a neg and awar as i must be of the weighti ground there ar for oppos my belief it still seem to me that the homer question is on that is reserv for a higher critic than it ha often obtain we ar not by natur intend to know all thing still less to compass the power by which the greatest bless of life have been place at our dispos were faith no virtu then we might inde wonder why god will our ignor on ani matter but we ar too well taught the contrari lesson and it seem as though our faith should be especi tri touch the men and the event which have wrought most influenc upon the condit of human and there is a kind of sacred attach to the memori of the great and the good which seem to bid us repuls the sceptic which would allegor their exist into a pleas apologu and measur the giant of intellect by an homeopath dynamet long and habitu read of homer appear to familiar our thought even to hi incongru or rather if we read in a right spirit and with a heartfelt appreci we ar too much dazzl too deepli wrap in admir of the whole to dwell upon the minut spot which mere analysi can discov in read an heroic poem we must transform ourselv into hero of the time be we in imagin must fight over the same battl woo the same love burn with the same sens of injuri as an achil or a hector and if we can but attain thi degre of enthusiasm and less enthusiasm will scarc suffic for the read of homer we shall feel that the poem of homer ar not onli the work of on writer but of the greatest writer that ever touch the heart of men by the power of song and it wa thi suppos uniti of authorship which gave these poem their power influenc over the mind of the men of old heeren who is evid littl dispos in favour of modern theori fine observ it wa homer who form the charact of the greek nation no poet ha ever as a poet exercis a similar influenc over hi countrymen prophet lawgiv and sage have form the charact of other nation it wa reserv to a poet to form that of the greek thi is a featur in their charact which wa not wholli eras even in the period of their degeneraci when lawgiv and sage appear in greec the work of the poet had alreadi been accomplish and thei paid homag to hi superior geniu he held up befor hi nation the mirror in which thei were to behold the world of god and hero no less than of feebl mortal and to behold them reflect with puriti and truth hi poem ar found on the first feel of human natur on the love of children wife and countri on that passion which outweigh all other the love of glori hi song were pour forth from a breast which sympath with all the feel of man and therefor thei enter and will continu to enter everi breast which cherish the same sympathi if it is grant to hi immort spirit from anoth heaven than ani of which he dream on earth to look down on hi race to see the nation from the field of asia to the forest of hercynia perform pilgrimag to the fountain which hi magic wand caus to flow if it is permit to him to view the vast assemblag of grand of elev of gloriou product which had been call into be by mean of hi song wherev hi immort spirit mai resid thi alon would suffic to complet hi happi can we contempl that ancient monument on which the apotheosi of homer is depictur and not feel how much of pleas associ how much that appeal most forcibl and most distinctli to our mind is lost by the admitt of ani theori but our old tradit the more we read and the more we think think as becom the reader of homer the more root becom the convict that the father of poetri gave us thi rich inherit whole and entir whatev were the mean of it preserv let us rather be thank for the treasuri of tast and eloqu thu laid open to our us than seek to make it a mere centr around which to drive a seri of theori whose wild is onli equal by their inconsist with each other as the hymn and some other poem usual ascrib to homer ar not includ in pope s translat i will content myself with a brief account of the battl of the frog and mice from the pen of a writer who ha done it full justic thi poem sai coleridg is a short mock heroic of ancient date the text vari in differ edit and is obvious disturb and corrupt to a great degre it is commonli said to have been a juvenil essai of homer s geniu other have attribut it to the same pigre mention abov and whose reput for humour seem to have invit the appropri of ani piec of ancient wit the author of which wa uncertain so littl did the greek befor the ag of the ptolemi know or care about that depart of critic emploi in determin the genuin of ancient write as to thi littl poem be a youth prolus of homer it seem suffici to sai that from the begin to the end it is a plain and palpabl parodi not onli of the gener spirit but of the numer passag of the iliad itself and even if no such intent to parodi were discern in it the object would still remain that to suppos a work of mere burlesqu to be the primari effort of poetri in a simpl ag seem to revers that order in the develop of nation tast which the histori of everi other peopl in europ and of mani in asia ha almost ascertain to be a law of the human mind it is in a state of societi much more refin and perman than that describ in the iliad that ani popular would attend such a ridicul of war and the god as is contain in thi poem and the fact of there have exist three other poem of the same kind attribut for aught we can see with as much reason to homer is a strong induc to believ that none of them were of the homer ag knight infer from the usag of the word delto write tablet instead of diphthera skin which accord to herod wa the materi emploi by the asiat greek for that purpos that thi poem wa anoth offspr of attic ingenu and gener that the familiar mention of the cock v is a strong argument against so ancient a date for it composit have thu given a brief account of the poem compris in pope s design i will now proce to make a few remark on hi translat and on my own purpos in the present edit pope wa not a grecian hi whole educ had been irregular and hi earliest acquaint with the poet wa through the version of ogilbi it is not too much to sai that hi whole work bear the impress of a disposit to be satisfi with the gener sens rather than to dive deepli into the minut and delic featur of languag henc hi whole work is to be look upon rather as an eleg paraphras than a translat there ar to be sure certain convent anecdot which prove that pope consult variou friend whose classic attain were sounder than hi own dure the undertak but it is probabl that these examin were the result rather of the contradictori version alreadi exist than of a desir to make a perfect transcript of the origin and in those dai what is call liter translat wa less cultiv than at present if someth like the gener sens could be decor with the easi grace of a practis poet if the charm of metric cadenc and a pleas fluenci could be made consist with a fair interpret of the poet s mean hi word were less jealous sought for and those who could read so good a poem as pope s iliad had fair reason to be satisfi it would be absurd therefor to test pope s translat by our own advanc knowledg of the origin text we must be content to look at it as a most delight work in itself a work which is as much a part of english literatur as homer himself is of greek we must not be torn from our kindli associ with the old iliad that onc wa our most cherish companion or our most look for prize mere becaus buttmann loew and liddel have made us so much more accur as to amphikupellon be an adject and not a substant far be it from us to defend the fault of pope especi when we think of chapman s fine bold rough old english far be it from us to hold up hi translat as what a translat of homer might be but we can still dismiss pope s iliad to the hand of our reader with the conscious that thei must have read a veri great number of book befor thei have read it fellow as to the note accompani the present volum thei ar drawn up without pretens and mainli with the view of help the gener reader have some littl time sinc translat all the work of homer for anoth publish i might have brought a larg amount of accumul matter sometim of a critic charact to bear upon the text but pope s version wa no field for such a displai and my purpos wa to touch briefli on antiquarian or mytholog allus to notic occasion some departur from the origin and to give a few parallel passag from our english homer milton in the latter task i cannot pretend to novelti but i trust that my other annot while utterli disclaim high scholast view will be found to convei as much as is want at least as far as the necessari limit of these volum could be expect to admit to write a commentari on homer is not my present aim but if i have made pope s translat a littl more entertain and instruct to a mass of miscellan reader i shall consid my wish satisfactorili accomplish theodor aloi bucklei christ church pope s prefac to the iliad of homer homer is univers allow to have had the greatest invent of ani writer whatev the prais of judgment virgil ha justli contest with him and other mai have their pretens as to particular excel but hi invent remain yet unrival nor is it a wonder if he ha ever been acknowledg the greatest of poet who most excel in that which is the veri foundat of poetri it is the invent that in differ degre distinguish all great genius the utmost stretch of human studi learn and industri which master everyth besid can never attain to thi it furnish art with all her materi and without it judgment itself can at best but steal wise for art is onli like a prudent steward that live on manag the rich of natur whatev prais mai be given to work of judgment there is not even a singl beauti in them to which the invent must not contribut as in the most regular garden art can onli reduc beauti of natur to more regular and such a figur which the common ey mai better take in and is therefor more entertain with and perhap the reason why common critic ar inclin to prefer a judici and method geniu to a great and fruit on is becaus thei find it easier for themselv to pursu their observ through a uniform and bound walk of art than to comprehend the vast and variou extent of natur our author s work is a wild paradis where if we cannot see all the beauti so distinctli as in an order garden it is onli becaus the number of them is infinit greater it is like a copiou nurseri which contain the seed and first product of everi kind out of which those who follow him have but select some particular plant each accord to hi fanci to cultiv and beautifi if some thing ar too luxuri it is ow to the rich of the soil and if other ar not arriv to perfect or matur it is onli becaus thei ar overrun and oppress by those of a stronger natur it is to the strength of thi amaz invent we ar to attribut that unequal fire and raptur which is so forcibl in homer that no man of a true poetic spirit is master of himself while he read him what he write is of the most anim natur imagin everi thing move everi thing live and is put in action if a council be call or a battl fought you ar not coldli inform of what wa said or done as from a third person the reader is hurri out of himself by the forc of the poet s imagin and turn in on place to a hearer in anoth to a spectat the cours of hi vers resembl that of the armi he describ hoid ar isan hosei te puri chthon pasa nemoito thei pour along like a fire that sweep the whole earth befor it it is howev remark that hi fanci which is everywher vigor is not discov immedi at the begin of hi poem in it fullest splendour it grow in the progress both upon himself and other and becom on fire like a chariot wheel by it own rapid exact disposit just thought correct elocut polish number mai have been found in a thousand but thi poetic fire thi vivida vi animi in a veri few even in work where all those ar imperfect or neglect thi can overpow critic and make us admir even while we disapprov nai where thi appear though attend with absurd it brighten all the rubbish about it till we see noth but it own splendour thi fire is discern in virgil but discern as through a glass reflect from homer more shine than fierc but everywher equal and constant in lucan and statiu it burst out in sudden short and interrupt flash in milton it glow like a furnac kept up to an uncommon ardour by the forc of art in shakspear it strike befor we ar awar like an accident fire from heaven but in homer and in him onli it burn everywher clearli and everywher irresist i shall here endeavour to show how thi vast invent exert itself in a manner superior to that of ani poet through all the main constitu part of hi work as it is the great and peculiar characterist which distinguish him from all other author thi strong and rule faculti wa like a power star which in the violenc of it cours drew all thing within it vortex it seem not enough to have taken in the whole circl of art and the whole compass of natur to suppli hi maxim and reflect all the inward passion and affect of mankind to furnish hi charact and all the outward form and imag of thing for hi descript but want yet an ampler sphere to expati in he open a new and boundless walk for hi imagin and creat a world for himself in the invent of fabl that which aristotl call the soul of poetri wa first breath into it by homer i shall begin with consid him in hi part as it is natur the first and i speak of it both as it mean the design of a poem and as it is taken for fiction fabl mai be divid into the probabl the allegor and the marvel the probabl fabl is the recit of such action as though thei did not happen yet might in the common cours of natur or of such as though thei did becam fabl by the addit episod and manner of tell them of thi sort is the main stori of an epic poem the return of ulyss the settlement of the trojan in itali or the like that of the iliad is the anger of achil the most short and singl subject that ever wa chosen by ani poet yet thi he ha suppli with a vaster varieti of incid and event and crowd with a greater number of council speech battl and episod of all kind than ar to be found even in those poem whose scheme ar of the utmost latitud and irregular the action is hurri on with the most vehement spirit and it whole durat emploi not so much as fifti dai virgil for want of so warm a geniu aid himself by take in a more extens subject as well as a greater length of time and contract the design of both homer s poem into on which is yet but a fourth part as larg as hi the other epic poet have us the same practic but gener carri it so far as to superinduc a multipl of fabl destroi the uniti of action and lose their reader in an unreason length of time nor is it onli in the main design that thei have been unabl to add to hi invent but thei have follow him in everi episod and part of stori if he ha given a regular catalogu of an armi thei all draw up their forc in the same order if he ha funer game for patroclu virgil ha the same for anchis and statiu rather than omit them destroi the uniti of hi action for those of archemoru if ulyss visit the shade the nea of virgil and scipio of siliu ar sent after him if he be detain from hi return by the allur of calypso so is nea by dido and rinaldo by armida if achil be absent from the armi on the score of a quarrel through half the poem rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account if he give hi hero a suit of celesti armour virgil and tasso make the same present to their virgil ha not onli observ thi close imit of homer but where he had not led the wai suppli the want from other greek author thu the stori of sinon and the take of troi wa copi sai macrobiu almost word for word from pisand as the love of dido and nea ar taken from those of medea and jason in apolloniu and sever other in the same manner to proce to the allegor fabl if we reflect upon those innumer knowledg those secret of natur and physic philosophi which homer is gener suppos to have wrap up in hi allegori what a new and ampl scene of wonder mai thi consider afford us how fertil will that imagin appear which as abl to cloth all the properti of element the qualif of the mind the virtu and vice in form and person and to introduc them into action agreeabl to the natur of the thing thei shadow thi is a field in which no succeed poet could disput with homer and whatev commend have been allow them on thi head ar by no mean for their invent in have enlarg hi circl but for their judgment in have contract it for when the mode of learn chang in the follow ag and scienc wa deliv in a plainer manner it then becam as reason in the more modern poet to lai it asid as it wa in homer to make us of it and perhap it wa no unhappi circumst for virgil that there wa not in hi time that demand upon him of so great an invent as might be capabl of furnish all those allegor part of a poem the marvel fabl includ whatev is supernatur and especi the machin of the god if homer wa not the first who introduc the deiti as herodotu imagin into the religion of greec he seem the first who brought them into a system of machineri for poetri and such a on as make it greatest import and digniti for we find those author who have been offend at the liter notion of the god constantli lai their accus against homer as the chief support of it but whatev caus there might be to blame hi machin in a philosoph or religi view thei ar so perfect in the poetic that mankind have been ever sinc content to follow them none have been abl to enlarg the sphere of poetri beyond the limit he ha set everi attempt of thi natur ha prove unsuccess and after all the variou chang of time and religion hi god continu to thi dai the god of poetri we come now to the charact of hi person and here we shall find no author ha ever drawn so mani with so visibl and surpris a varieti or given us such live and affect impress of them everi on ha someth so singularli hi own that no painter could have distinguish them more by their featur than the poet ha by their manner noth can be more exact than the distinct he ha observ in the differ degre of virtu and vice the singl qualiti of courag is wonderfulli diversifi in the sever charact of the iliad that of achil is furiou and intract that of diomed forward yet listen to advic and subject to command that of ajax is heavi and self confid of hector activ and vigil the courag of agamemnon is inspirit by love of empir and ambit that of menelau mix with soft and tender for hi peopl we find in idomeneu a plain direct soldier in sarpedon a gallant and gener on nor is thi judici and astonish divers to be found onli in the princip qualiti which constitut the main of each charact but even in the under part of it to which he take care to give a tinctur of that princip on for exampl the main charact of ulyss and nestor consist in wisdom and thei ar distinct in thi that the wisdom of on is artifici and variou of the other natur open and regular but thei have besid charact of courag and thi qualiti also take a differ turn in each from the differ of hi prudenc for on in the war depend still upon caution the other upon experi it would be endless to produc instanc of these kind the charact of virgil ar far from strike us in thi open manner thei lie in a great degre hidden and undistinguish and where thei ar mark most evid affect us not in proport to those of homer hi charact of valour ar much alik even that of turnu seem no wai peculiar but as it is in a superior degre and we see noth that differ the courag of mnestheu from that of sergestu cloanthu or the rest in like manner it mai be remark of statiu s hero that an air of impetuos run through them all the same horrid and savag courag appear in hi capaneu tydeu hippomedon c thei have a pariti of charact which make them seem brother of on famili i believ when the reader is led into thi tract of reflect if he will pursu it through the epic and tragic writer he will be convinc how infinit superior in thi point the invent of homer wa to that of all other the speech ar to be consid as thei flow from the charact be perfect or defect as thei agre or disagre with the manner of those who utter them as there is more varieti of charact in the iliad so there is of speech than in ani other poem everyth in it ha manner as aristotl express it that is everyth is act or spoken it is hardli credibl in a work of such length how small a number of line ar emploi in narrat in virgil the dramat part is less in proport to the narr and the speech often consist of gener reflect or thought which might be equal just in ani person s mouth upon the same occas as mani of hi person have no appar charact so mani of hi speech escap be appli and judg by the rule of proprieti we often think of the author himself when we read virgil than when we ar engag in homer all which ar the effect of a colder invent that interest us less in the action describ homer make us hearer and virgil leav us reader if in the next place we take a view of the sentiment the same presid faculti is emin in the sublim and spirit of hi thought longinu ha given hi opinion that it wa in thi part homer princip excel what were alon suffici to prove the grandeur and excel of hi sentiment in gener is that thei have so remark a pariti with those of the scriptur duport in hi gnomologia homerica ha collect innumer instanc of thi sort and it is with justic an excel modern writer allow that if virgil ha not so mani thought that ar low and vulgar he ha not so mani that ar sublim and nobl and that the roman author seldom rise into veri astonish sentiment where he is not fire by the iliad if we observ hi descript imag and simil we shall find the invent still predomin to what els can we ascrib that vast comprehens of imag of everi sort where we see each circumst of art and individu of natur summon togeth by the extent and fecund of hi imagin to which all thing in their variou view present themselv in an instant and had their impress taken off to perfect at a heat nai he not onli give us the full prospect of thing but sever unexpect peculiar and side view unobserv by ani painter but homer noth is so surpris as the descript of hi battl which take up no less than half the iliad and ar suppli with so vast a varieti of incid that no on bear a like to anoth such differ kind of death that no two hero ar wound in the same manner and such a profus of nobl idea that everi battl rise abov the last in great horror and confus it is certain there is not near that number of imag and descript in ani epic poet though everi on ha assist himself with a great quantiti out of him and it is evid of virgil especi that he ha scarc ani comparison which ar not drawn from hi master if we descend from henc to the express we see the bright imagin of homer shine out in the most enliven form of it we acknowledg him the father of poetic diction the first who taught that languag of the god to men hi express is like the colour of some great master which discov itself to be laid on boldli and execut with rapid it is inde the strongest and most glow imagin and touch with the greatest spirit aristotl had reason to sai he wa the onli poet who had found out live word there ar in him more dare figur and metaphor than in ani good author whatev an arrow is impati to be on the wing a weapon thirst to drink the blood of an enemi and the like yet hi express is never too big for the sens but justli great in proport to it it is the sentiment that swell and fill out the diction which rise with it and form itself about it for in the same degre that a thought is warmer an express will be brighter as that is more strong thi will becom more perspicu like glass in the furnac which grow to a greater magnitud and refin to a greater clear onli as the breath within is more power and the heat more intens to throw hi languag more out of prose homer seem to have affect the compound epithet thi wa a sort of composit peculiarli proper to poetri not onli as it heighten the diction but as it assist and fill the number with greater sound and pomp and likewis conduc in some measur to thicken the imag on thi last consider i cannot but attribut these also to the fruit of hi invent sinc as he ha manag them thei ar a sort of supernumerari pictur of the person or thing to which thei were join we see the motion of hector s plume in the epithet korythaiolo the landscap of mount neritu in that of einosiphyllo and so of other which particular imag could not have been insist upon so long as to express them in a descript though but of a singl line without divert the reader too much from the princip action or figur as a metaphor is a short simil on of these epithet is a short descript lastli if we consid hi versif we shall be sensibl what a share of prais is due to hi invent in that also he wa not satisfi with hi languag as he found it settl in ani on part of greec but search through it differ dialect with thi particular view to beautifi and perfect hi number he consid these as thei had a greater mixtur of vowel or conson and accordingli emploi them as the vers requir either a greater smooth or strength what he most affect wa the ionic which ha a peculiar sweet from it never us contract and from it custom of resolv the diphthong into two syllabl so as to make the word open themselv with a more spread and sonor fluenci with thi he mingl the attic contract the broader doric and the feebler olic which often reject it aspir or take off it accent and complet thi varieti by alter some letter with the licenc of poetri thu hi measur instead of be fetter to hi sens were alwai in readi to run along with the warmth of hi raptur and even to give a further represent of hi notion in the correspond of their sound to what thei signifi out of all these he ha deriv that harmoni which make us confess he had not onli the richest head but the finest ear in the world thi is so great a truth that whoever will but consult the tune of hi vers even without understand them with the same sort of dilig as we daili see practis in the case of italian opera will find more sweet varieti and majesti of sound than in ani other languag of poetri the beauti of hi number is allow by the critic to be copi but faintli by virgil himself though thei ar so just as to ascrib it to the natur of the latin tongu inde the greek ha some advantag both from the natur sound of it word and the turn and cadenc of it vers which agre with the geniu of no other languag virgil wa veri sensibl of thi and us the utmost dilig in work up a more intract languag to whatsoev grace it wa capabl of and in particular never fail to bring the sound of hi line to a beauti agreement with it sens if the grecian poet ha not been so frequent celebr on thi account as the roman the onli reason is that fewer critic have understood on languag than the other dionysiu of halicarnassu ha point out mani of our author s beauti in thi kind in hi treatis of the composit of word it suffic at present to observ of hi number that thei flow with so much eas as to make on imagin homer had no other care than to transcrib as fast as the muse dictat and at the same time with so much forc and inspirit vigour that thei awaken and rais us like the sound of a trumpet thei roll along as a plenti river alwai in motion and alwai full while we ar born awai by a tide of vers the most rapid and yet the most smooth imagin thu on whatev side we contempl homer what princip strike us is hi invent it is that which form the charact of each part of hi work and accordingli we find it to have made hi fabl more extens and copiou than ani other hi manner more live and strongli mark hi speech more affect and transport hi sentiment more warm and sublim hi imag and descript more full and anim hi express more rais and dare and hi number more rapid and variou i hope in what ha been said of virgil with regard to ani of these head i have no wai derog from hi charact noth is more absurd or endless than the common method of compar emin writer by an opposit of particular passag in them and form a judgment from thenc of their merit upon the whole we ought to have a certain knowledg of the princip charact and distinguish excel of each it is in that we ar to consid him and in proport to hi degre in that we ar to admir him no author or man ever excel all the world in more than on faculti and as homer ha done thi in invent virgil ha in judgment not that we ar to think that homer want judgment becaus virgil had it in a more emin degre or that virgil want invent becaus homer possess a larger share of it each of these great author had more of both than perhap ani man besid and ar onli said to have less in comparison with on anoth homer wa the greater geniu virgil the better artist in on we most admir the man in the other the work homer hurri and transport us with a command impetuos virgil lead us with an attract majesti homer scatter with a gener profus virgil bestow with a care magnific homer like the nile pour out hi rich with a boundless overflow virgil like a river in it bank with a gentl and constant stream when we behold their battl methink the two poet resembl the hero thei celebr homer boundless and resistless as achil bear all befor him and shine more and more as the tumult increas virgil calmli dare like nea appear undisturb in the midst of the action dispos all about him and conquer with tranquil and when we look upon their machin homer seem like hi own jupit in hi terror shake olympu scatter the lightn and fire the heaven virgil like the same power in hi benevol counsel with the god lai plan for empir and regularli order hi whole creation but after all it is with great part as with great virtu thei natur border on some imperfect and it is often hard to distinguish exactli where the virtu end or the fault begin as prudenc mai sometim sink to suspicion so mai a great judgment declin to cold and as magnanim mai run up to profus or extravag so mai a great invent to redund or wild if we look upon homer in thi view we shall perceiv the chief object against him to proce from so nobl a caus as the excess of thi faculti among these we mai reckon some of hi marvel fiction upon which so much critic ha been spent as surpass all the bound of probabl perhap it mai be with great and superior soul as with gigant bodi which exert themselv with unusu strength exce what is commonli thought the due proport of part to becom miracl in the whole and like the old hero of that make commit someth near extravag amidst a seri of gloriou and inimit perform thu homer ha hi speak hors and virgil hi myrtl distil blood where the latter ha not so much as contriv the easi intervent of a deiti to save the probabl it is ow to the same vast invent that hi simil have been thought too exuber and full of circumst the forc of thi faculti is seen in noth more than in it inabl to confin itself to that singl circumst upon which the comparison is ground it run out into embellish of addit imag which howev ar so manag as not to overpow the main on hi simil ar like pictur where the princip figur ha not onli it proport given agreeabl to the origin but is also set off with occasion ornament and prospect the same will account for hi manner of heap a number of comparison togeth in on breath when hi fanci suggest to him at onc so mani variou and correspond imag the reader will easili extend thi observ to more object of the same kind if there ar other which seem rather to charg him with a defect or narrow of geniu than an excess of it those seem defect will be found upon examin to proce wholli from the natur of the time he live in such ar hi grosser represent of the god and the viciou and imperfect manner of hi hero but i must here speak a word of the latter as it is a point gener carri into extrem both by the censur and defend of homer it must be a strang partial to antiqu to think with madam dacier that those time and manner ar so much the more excel as thei ar more contrari to our who can be so prejud in their favour as to magnifi the felic of those ag when a spirit of reveng and cruelti join with the practic of rapin and robberi reign through the world when no merci wa shown but for the sake of lucr when the greatest princ were put to the sword and their wive and daughter made slave and concubin on the other side i would not be so delic as those modern critic who ar shock at the servil offic and mean employ in which we sometim see the hero of homer engag there is a pleasur in take a view of that simplic in opposit to the luxuri of succeed ag in behold monarch without their guard princ tend their flock and princess draw water from the spring when we read homer we ought to reflect that we ar read the most ancient author in the heathen world and those who consid him in thi light will doubl their pleasur in the perus of him let them think thei ar grow acquaint with nation and peopl that ar now no more that thei ar step almost three thousand year back into the remotest antiqu and entertain themselv with a clear and surpris vision of thing nowher els to be found the onli true mirror of that ancient world by thi mean alon their greatest obstacl will vanish and what usual creat their dislik will becom a satisfact thi consider mai further serv to answer for the constant us of the same epithet to hi god and hero such as the far dart phoebu the blue ei palla the swift foot achil c which some have censur as impertin and tedious repeat those of the god depend upon the power and offic then believ to belong to them and had contract a weight and vener from the rite and solemn devot in which thei were us thei were a sort of attribut with which it wa a matter of religion to salut them on all occas and which it wa an irrever to omit as for the epithet of great men mon boileau is of opinion that thei were in the natur of surnam and repeat as such for the greek have no name deriv from their father were oblig to add some other distinct of each person either name hi parent expressli or hi place of birth profess or the like as alexand the son of philip herodotu of halicarnassu diogen the cynic c homer therefor compli with the custom of hi countri us such distinct addit as better agre with poetri and inde we have someth parallel to these in modern time such as the name of harold harefoot edmund ironsid edward longshank edward the black princ c if yet thi be thought to account better for the proprieti than for the repetit i shall add a further conjectur hesiod divid the world into it differ ag ha place a fourth ag between the brazen and the iron on of hero distinct from other men a divin race who fought at thebe and troi ar call demi god and live by the care of jupit in the island of the bless now among the divin honour which were paid them thei might have thi also in common with the god not to be mention without the solemn of an epithet and such as might be accept to them by celebr their famili action or qualiti what other cavil have been rais against homer ar such as hardli deserv a repli but will yet be taken notic of as thei occur in the cours of the work mani have been occas by an injudici endeavour to exalt virgil which is much the same as if on should think to rais the superstructur by undermin the foundat on would imagin by the whole cours of their parallel that these critic never so much as heard of homer s have written first a consider which whoever compar these two poet ought to have alwai in hi ey some accus him for the same thing which thei overlook or prais in the other as when thei prefer the fabl and moral of the nei to those of the iliad for the same reason which might set the odyssei abov the nei as that the hero is a wiser man and the action of the on more benefici to hi countri than that of the other or els thei blame him for not do what he never design as becaus achil is not as good and perfect a princ as nea when the veri moral of hi poem requir a contrari charact it is thu that rapin judg in hi comparison of homer and virgil other select those particular passag of homer which ar not so labour as some that virgil drew out of them thi is the whole manag of scalig in hi poetic other quarrel with what thei take for low and mean express sometim through a fals delicaci and refin often from an ignor of the grace of the origin and then triumph in the awkward of their own translat thi is the conduct of perrault in hi parallel lastli there ar other who pretend to a fairer proceed distinguish between the person merit of homer and that of hi work but when thei come to assign the caus of the great reput of the iliad thei found it upon the ignor of hi time and the prejudic of those that follow and in pursuanc of thi principl thei make those accid such as the content of the citi c to be the caus of hi fame which were in realiti the consequ of hi merit the same might as well be said of virgil or ani great author whose gener charact will infal rais mani casual addit to their reput thi is the method of mon de la mott who yet confess upon the whole that in whatev ag homer had live he must have been the greatest poet of hi nation and that he mai be said in hi sens to be the master even of those who surpass him in all these object we see noth that contradict hi titl to the honour of the chief invent and as long as thi which is inde the characterist of poetri itself remain unequal by hi follow he still continu superior to them a cooler judgment mai commit fewer fault and be more approv in the ey of on sort of critic but that warmth of fanci will carri the loudest and most univers applaus which hold the heart of a reader under the strongest enchant homer not onli appear the inventor of poetri but excel all the inventor of other art in thi that he ha swallow up the honour of those who succeed him what he ha done admit no increas it onli left room for contract or regul he show all the stretch of fanci at onc and if he ha fail in some of hi flight it wa but becaus he attempt everyth a work of thi kind seem like a mighti tree which rise from the most vigor seed is improv with industri flourish and produc the finest fruit natur and art conspir to rais it pleasur and profit join to make it valuabl and thei who find the justest fault have onli said that a few branch which run luxuri through a rich of natur might be lop into form to give it a more regular appear have now spoken of the beauti and defect of the origin it remain to treat of the translat with the same view to the chief characterist as far as that is seen in the main part of the poem such as the fabl manner and sentiment no translat can prejudic it but by wil omiss or contract as it also break out in everi particular imag descript and simil whoever lessen or too much soften those take off from thi chief charact it is the first grand duti of an interpret to give hi author entir and unmaim and for the rest the diction and versif onli ar hi proper provinc sinc these must be hi own but the other he is to take as he find them it should then be consid what method mai afford some equival in our languag for the grace of these in the greek it is certain no liter translat can be just to an excel origin in a superior languag but it is a great mistak to imagin as mani have done that a rash paraphras can make amend for thi gener defect which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient by deviat into the modern manner of express if there be sometim a dark there is often a light in antiqu which noth better preserv than a version almost liter i know no liberti on ought to take but those which ar necessari to transfus the spirit of the origin and support the poetic style of the translat and i will ventur to sai there have not been more men misl in former time by a servil dull adher to the letter than have been delud in our by a chimer insol hope of rais and improv their author it is not to be doubt that the fire of the poem is what a translat should princip regard as it is most like to expir in hi manag howev it is hi safest wai to be content with preserv thi to hi utmost in the whole without endeavour to be more than he find hi author is in ani particular place it is a great secret in write to know when to be plain and when poetic and figur and it is what homer will teach us if we will but follow modestli in hi footstep where hi diction is bold and lofti let us rais our as high as we can but where hi is plain and humbl we ought not to be deter from imit him by the fear of incur the censur of a mere english critic noth that belong to homer seem to have been more commonli mistaken than the just pitch of hi style some of hi translat have swell into fustian in a proud confid of the sublim other sunk into flat in a cold and timor notion of simplic methink i see these differ follow of homer some sweat and strain after him by violent leap and bound the certain sign of fals mettl other slowli and servil creep in hi train while the poet himself is all the time proceed with an unaffect and equal majesti befor them howev of the two extrem on could sooner pardon frenzi than frigid no author is to be envi for such commend as he mai gain by that charact of style which hi friend must agre togeth to call simplic and the rest of the world will call dul there is a grace and dignifi simplic as well as a bold and sordid on which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven it is on thing to be trick up and anoth not to be dress at all simplic is the mean between ostent and rustic thi pure and nobl simplic is nowher in such perfect as in the scriptur and our author on mai affirm with all respect to the inspir write that the divin spirit made us of no other word but what were intellig and common to men at that time and in that part of the world and as homer is the author nearest to those hi style must of cours bear a greater resembl to the sacr book than that of ani other writer thi consider togeth with what ha been observ of the pariti of some of hi thought mai methink induc a translat on the on hand to give in to sever of those gener phrase and manner of express which have attain a vener even in our languag from be us in the old testament as on the other to avoid those which have been appropri to the divin and in a manner consign to mysteri and religion for a further preserv of thi air of simplic a particular care should be taken to express with all plain those moral sentenc and proverbi speech which ar so numer in thi poet thei have someth vener and as i mai sai oracular in that unadorn graviti and short with which thei ar deliv a grace which would be utterli lost by endeavour to give them what we call a more ingeni that is a more modern turn in the paraphras perhap the mixtur of some graecism and old word after the manner of milton if done without too much affect might not have an ill effect in a version of thi particular work which most of ani other seem to requir a vener antiqu cast but certainli the us of modern term of war and govern such as platoon campaign junto or the like into which some of hi translat have fallen cannot be allow those onli except without which it is imposs to treat the subject in ani live languag there ar two peculiar in homer s diction which ar a sort of mark or mole by which everi common ey distinguish him at first sight those who ar not hi greatest admir look upon them as defect and those who ar seem pleas with them as beauti i speak of hi compound epithet and of hi repetit mani of the former cannot be done liter into english without destroi the puriti of our languag i believ such should be retain as slide easili of themselv into an english compound without violenc to the ear or to the receiv rule of composit as well as those which have receiv a sanction from the author of our best poet and ar becom familiar through their us of them such as the cloud compel jove c as for the rest whenev ani can be as fulli and significantli express in a singl word as in a compound on the cours to be taken is obviou some that cannot be so turn as to preserv their full imag by on or two word mai have justic done them by circumlocut as the epithet einosiphyllo to a mountain would appear littl or ridicul translat liter leaf shake but afford a majest idea in the periphrasi the lofti mountain shake hi wave wood other that admit of differ signif mai receiv an advantag from a judici variat accord to the occas on which thei ar introduc for exampl the epithet of apollo hekaebolo or far shoot is capabl of two explic on liter in respect of the dart and bow the ensign of that god the other allegor with regard to the rai of the sun therefor in such place where apollo is repres as a god in person i would us the former interpret and where the effect of the sun ar describ i would make choic of the latter upon the whole it will be necessari to avoid that perpetu repetit of the same epithet which we find in homer and which though it might be accommod as ha been alreadi shown to the ear of those time is by no mean so to our but on mai wait for opportun of place them where thei deriv an addit beauti from the occas on which thei ar emploi and in do thi properli a translat mai at onc show hi fanci and hi judgment as for homer s repetit we mai divid them into three sort of whole narrat and speech of singl sentenc and of on vers or hemistitch i hope it is not imposs to have such a regard to these as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the on hand nor to offend the reader too much on the other the repetit is not ungrac in those speech where the digniti of the speaker render it a sort of insol to alter hi word as in the messag from god to men or from higher power to inferior in concern of state or where the ceremoni of religion seem to requir it in the solemn form of prayer oath or the like in other case i believ the best rule is to be guid by the near or distanc at which the repetit ar place in the origin when thei follow too close on mai vari the express but it is a question whether a profess translat be author to omit ani if thei be tediou the author is to answer for it it onli remain to speak of the versif homer as ha been said is perpetu appli the sound to the sens and vari it on everi new subject thi is inde on of the most exquisit beauti of poetri and attain by veri few i onli know of homer emin for it in the greek and virgil in the latin i am sensibl it is what mai sometim happen by chanc when a writer is warm and fulli possess of hi imag howev it mai reason be believ thei design thi in whose vers it so manifestli appear in a superior degre to all other few reader have the ear to be judg of it but those who have will see i have endeavour at thi beauti upon the whole i must confess myself utterli incap of do justic to homer i attempt him in no other hope but that which on mai entertain without much vaniti of give a more toler copi of him than ani entir translat in vers ha yet done we have onli those of chapman hobb and ogilbi chapman ha taken the advantag of an immeasur length of vers notwithstand which there is scarc ani paraphras more loos and rambl than hi he ha frequent interpol of four or six line and i rememb on in the thirteenth book of the odyssei ver where he ha spun twenti vers out of two he is often mistaken in so bold a manner that on might think he deviat on purpos if he did not in other place of hi note insist so much upon verbal trifl he appear to have had a strong affect of extract new mean out of hi author insomuch as to promis in hi rhyme prefac a poem of the mysteri he had reveal in homer and perhap he endeavour to strain the obviou sens to thi end hi express is involv in fustian a fault for which he wa remark in hi origin write as in the tragedi of bussi d ambois c in a word the natur of the man mai account for hi whole perform for he appear from hi prefac and remark to have been of an arrog turn and an enthusiast in poetri hi own boast of have finish half the iliad in less than fifteen week show with what neglig hi version wa perform but that which is to be allow him and which veri much contribut to cover hi defect is a dare fieri spirit that anim hi translat which is someth like what on might imagin homer himself would have writ befor he arriv at year of discret hobb ha given us a correct explan of the sens in gener but for particular and circumst he continu lop them and often omit the most beauti as for it be esteem a close translat i doubt not mani have been led into that error by the short of it which proce not from hi follow the origin line by line but from the contract abov mention he sometim omit whole simil and sentenc and is now and then guilti of mistak into which no writer of hi learn could have fallen but through careless hi poetri as well as ogilbi s is too mean for critic it is a great loss to the poetic world that mr dryden did not live to translat the iliad he ha left us onli the first book and a small part of the sixth in which if he ha in some place not truli interpret the sens or preserv the antiqu it ought to be excus on account of the hast he wa oblig to write in he seem to have had too much regard to chapman whose word he sometim copi and ha unhappili follow him in passag where he wander from the origin howev had he translat the whole work i would no more have attempt homer after him than virgil hi version of whom notwithstand some human error is the most nobl and spirit translat i know in ani languag but the fate of great genius is like that of great minist though thei ar confessedli the first in the commonwealth of letter thei must be envi and calumni onli for be at the head of it that which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of ani on who translat homer is abov all thing to keep aliv that spirit and fire which make hi chief charact in particular place where the sens can bear ani doubt to follow the strongest and most poetic as most agre with that charact to copi him in all the variat of hi style and the differ modul of hi number to preserv in the more activ or descript part a warmth and elev in the more sedat or narr a plain and solemn in the speech a ful and perspicu in the sentenc a short and graviti not to neglect even the littl figur and turn on the word nor sometim the veri cast of the period neither to omit nor confound ani rite or custom of antiqu perhap too he ought to includ the whole in a shorter compass than ha hitherto been done by ani translat who ha toler preserv either the sens or poetri what i would further recommend to him is to studi hi author rather from hi own text than from ani commentari how learn soever or whatev figur thei mai make in the estim of the world to consid him attent in comparison with virgil abov all the ancient and with milton abov all the modern next these the archbishop of cambrai s telemachu mai give him the truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author and bossu s admir treatis of the epic poem the justest notion of hi design and conduct but after all with whatev judgment and studi a man mai proce or with whatev happi he mai perform such a work he must hope to pleas but a few those onli who have at onc a tast of poetri and compet learn for to satisfi such a want either is not in the natur of thi undertak sinc a mere modern wit can like noth that is not modern and a pedant noth that is not greek what i have done is submit to the public from whose opinion i am prepar to learn though i fear no judg so littl as our best poet who ar most sensibl of the weight of thi task as for the worst whatev thei shall pleas to sai thei mai give me some concern as thei ar unhappi men but none as thei ar malign writer i

mr addison wa the first whose advic determin me to undertak thi task who wa pleas to write to me upon that occas in such term as i cannot repeat without vaniti i wa oblig to sir richard steel for a

ani occas i must also acknowledg with infinit pleasur the mani friendli offic as well as sincer critic of mr congrev who had led me the wai in translat some part of homer i must add the name of mr row

undeserv by on who bear them so true an affect but what can i sai of the honour so mani of the great have done me while the first name of the ag appear as my subscrib and the most distinguish patron and ornament of learn as my chief encourag among these it is a particular pleasur to me to find that my highest oblig ar to such who have done most honour to the name of poet that hi grace the duke of buckingham wa not displeas i should undertak the author to whom he ha given in hi excel essai so complet a prais read homer onc and you can read no more for all book els appear so mean so poor vers will seem prose but still persist to read and homer will be all the book you need that the earl of halifax wa on of the first to favour me of whom it is hard to sai whether the advanc of the polit art is more ow to hi generos or hi exampl that such a geniu as my lord bolingbrok not more distinguish in the great scene of busi than in all the us and entertain part of learn ha not refus to be the critic of these sheet and the patron of their writer and that the nobl author of the tragedi of heroic love ha continu hi partial to me from my write pastor to my attempt the iliad i cannot deni myself the pride of confess that i have had the advantag not onli of their advic for the conduct in gener but their correct of sever particular of thi translat i could sai a great deal of the pleasur
