just about eleven o clock the door latch wa rais quietli and in step the master he threw himself into a chair laugh and groan and bid them all stand off for he wa nearli kill he would not have such anoth walk for the three kingdom and at the end of it to be flight to death he said open hi great coat which he held bundl up in hi arm see here wife i wa never so beaten with anyth in my life but you must e en take it as a gift of god though it s as dark almost as if it came from the devil we crowd round and over miss cathi s head i had a peep at a dirti rag black hair child big enough both to

earnshaw wa readi to fling it out of door she did fly up ask how he could fashion to bring that gipsi brat into the hous when thei had their own bairn to feed and fend for what he meant to do with it and whether he were mad the master tri to explain the matter but he wa realli half dead with fatigu and all that i could make out amongst her scold wa a tale of hi see it starv and houseless and as good as dumb in the street of liverpool where he pick it up and inquir for it owner not a soul knew to whom it belong he said and hi monei and time be both limit he thought it better to take it home with him at onc than run into vain expens there becaus he wa determin he would not leav it as he found it well the conclus wa that my mistress grumbl herself calm and mr earnshaw told me to wash it and give it clean thing and let it sleep with the children hindlei and cathi content themselv with look and listen till peac wa restor then both began search their father s pocket for the present he had promis them the former wa a boi of fourteen but when he drew out what had been a fiddl crush to morsel in the great coat he blubber aloud and cathi when she learn the master had lost her whip in attend on the stranger show her humour by grin and spit at the stupid littl thing earn for her pain a sound blow from her father to teach her cleaner manner thei entir refus to have it in bed with them or even in their room and i had no more sens so i put it on the land of the stair hope it might be gone on the morrow by chanc or els attract by hear hi voic it crept to mr earnshaw s door and there he found it on quit hi chamber inquiri were made as to how it got there i wa oblig to confess and in recompens for my cowardic and inhuman wa sent out of the hous thi wa heathcliff s first introduct to the famili on come back a few dai afterward for i did not consid my banish perpetu i found thei had christen him heathcliff it wa the name of a son who di in childhood and it ha serv him ever sinc both for christian and surnam miss cathi and he were now veri thick but hindlei hate him and to sai the truth i did the same and we plagu and went on with him shamefulli for i wasn t reason enough to feel my injustic and the mistress never put in a word on hi behalf when she saw him wrong he seem a sullen patient child harden perhap to ill treatment he would stand hindlei s blow without wink or shed a tear and my pinch move him onli to draw in a breath and open hi ey as if he had hurt himself by accid and nobodi wa to blame thi endur made old earnshaw furiou when he discov hi son persecut the poor fatherless child as he call him he took to heathcliff strang believ all he said for that matter he said preciou littl and gener the truth and pet him up far abov cathi who wa too mischiev and wayward for a favourit so from the veri begin he bred bad feel in the hous and at mr earnshaw s death which happen in less than two year after the young master had learn to regard hi father as an oppressor rather than a friend and heathcliff as a usurp of hi parent s affect and hi privileg and he grew bitter with brood over these injuri i sympathis a while but when the children fell ill of the measl and i had to tend them and take on me the care of a woman at onc i chang my idea heathcliff wa danger sick and while he lai at the worst he would have me constantli by hi pillow i suppos he felt i did a good deal for him and he hadn t wit to guess that i wa compel to do it howev i will sai thi he wa the quietest child that ever nurs watch over the differ between him and the other forc me to be less partial cathi and her brother harass me terribl he wa as uncomplain as a lamb though hard not gentl made him give littl troubl he got through and the doctor affirm it wa in a great measur ow to me and prais me for my care i wa vain of hi commend and soften toward the be by whose mean i earn them and thu hindlei lost hi last alli still i couldn t dote on heathcliff and i wonder often what my master saw to admir so much in the sullen boi who never to my recollect repaid hi indulg by ani sign of gratitud he wa not insol to hi benefactor he wa simpli insens though know perfectli the hold he had on hi heart and consciou he had onli to speak and all the hous would be oblig to bend to hi wish as an instanc i rememb mr earnshaw onc bought a coupl of colt at the parish fair and gave the lad each on heathcliff took the handsomest but it soon fell lame and when he discov it he said to hindlei you must exchang hors with me i don t like mine and if you won t i shall tell your father of the three thrash you ve given me thi week and show him my arm which is black to the shoulder hindlei put out hi tongu and cuf him over the ear you d better do it at onc he persist escap to the porch thei were in the stabl you will have to and if i speak of these blow you ll get them again with interest off dog cri hindlei threaten him with an iron weight us for weigh potato and hai throw it he repli stand still and then i ll tell how you boast that you would turn me out of door as soon as he di and see whether he will not turn you out directli hindlei threw it hit him on the breast and down he fell but stagger up immedi breathless and white and had not i prevent it he would have gone just so to the master and got full reveng by let hi condit plead for him intim who had caus it take my colt gipsi then said young earnshaw and i prai that he mai break your neck take him and be damn you beggarli interlop and wheedl my father out of all he ha onli afterward show him what you ar imp of satan and take that i hope he ll kick out your brain heathcliff had gone to loos the beast and shift it to hi own stall he wa pass behind it when hindlei finish hi speech by knock him under it feet and without stop to examin whether hi hope were fulfil ran awai as fast as he could i wa surpris to wit how coolli the child gather himself up and went on with hi intent exchang saddl and all and then sit down on a bundl of hai to overcom the qualm which the violent blow occas befor he enter the hous i persuad him easili to let me lai the blame of hi bruis on the hors he mind littl what tale wa told sinc he had what he want he complain so seldom inde of such stir as these that i realli thought him not vindict i wa deceiv complet as you will hear chapter v in the cours of time mr earnshaw began to fail he had been activ and healthi yet hi strength left him suddenli and when he wa confin to the chimnei corner he grew grievous irrit a noth vex him and suspect slight of hi author nearli threw him into fit thi wa especi to be remark if ani on attempt to impos upon or domin over hi favourit he wa painfulli jealou lest a word should be spoken amiss to him seem to have got into hi head the notion that becaus he like heathcliff all hate and long to do him an ill turn it wa a disadvantag to the lad for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master so we humour hi partial and that humour wa rich nourish to the child s pride and black temper still it becam in a manner necessari twice or thrice hindlei s manifest of scorn while hi father wa near rous the old man to a furi he seiz hi stick to strike him and shook with rage that he could not do it at last our curat we had a curat then who made the live answer by teach the littl linton and earnshaw and farm hi bit of land himself advis that the young man should be sent to colleg and mr earnshaw agre though with a heavi spirit for he said hindlei wa nought and would never thrive as where he wander i hope heartili we should have peac now it hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfort by hi own good deed i fanci the discont of ag and diseas aros from hi famili disagr as he would have it that it did realli you know sir it wa in hi sink frame we might have got on toler notwithstand but for two peopl miss cathi and joseph the servant you saw him i daresai up yonder he wa and is yet most like the wearisomest self righteou pharise that ever ransack a bibl to rake the promis to himself and fling the curs to hi neighbour by hi knack of sermonis and piou discours he contriv to make a great impress on mr earnshaw and the more feebl the master becam the more influenc he gain he wa relentless in worri him about hi soul s concern and about rule hi children rigidli he encourag him to regard hindlei as a reprob and night after night he regularli grumbl out a long string of tale against heathcliff and catherin alwai mind to flatter earnshaw s weak by heap the heaviest blame on the latter certainli she had wai with her such as i never saw a child take up befor and she put all of us past our patienc fifti time and often in a dai from the hour she came down stair till the hour she went to bed we had not a minut s secur that she wouldn t be in mischief her spirit were alwai at high water mark her tongu alwai go sing laugh and plagu everybodi who would not do the same a wild wick slip she wa but she had the bonniest ey the sweetest smile and lightest foot in the parish and after all i believ she meant no harm for when onc she made you cry in good earnest it seldom happen that she would not keep you compani and oblig you to be quiet that you might comfort her she wa much too fond of heathcliff the greatest punish we could invent for her wa to keep her separ from him yet she got chide more than ani of us on hi account in plai she like exceedingli to act the littl mistress us her hand freeli and command her companion she did so to me but i would not bear slap and order and so i let her know now mr earnshaw did not understand joke from hi children he had alwai been strict and grave with them and catherin on her part had no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in

not interest him he refus to open hi mouth except to utter pettish silli speech and he affirm i wa cruel and selfish for wish to talk when he wa so sick and sleepi he alwai contriv to be sick at the least cross i gave a few sentenc of commend to heathcliff and he either for a headach or a pang of envi began to cry so i got up and left him what us is it prais heathcliff to him i answer as lad thei had an avers to each other and heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him prais it s human natur let mr linton alon about him unless you would like an open quarrel between them but doe it not show great weak pursu she i m not enviou i never feel hurt at the bright of isabella s yellow hair and the white of her skin at her dainti eleg and the fond all the famili exhibit for her even you nelli if we have a disput sometim you back isabella at onc and i yield like a foolish mother i call her a darl and flatter her into a good temper it pleas her brother to see us cordial and that pleas me but thei ar veri much alik thei ar spoil children and fanci the world wa made for their accommod and though i humour both i think a smart chastis might improv them all the same you re mistaken mr linton said i thei humour you i know what there would be to do if thei did not you can well afford to indulg their pass whim as long as their busi is to anticip all your desir you mai howev fall out at last over someth of equal consequ to both side and then those you term weak ar veri capabl of be as obstin as you and then we shall fight to the death sha n t we nelli she return laugh no i tell you i have such faith in linton s love that i believ i might kill him and he wouldn t wish to retali i advis her to valu him the more for hi affect i do she answer but he needn t resort to whine for trifl it is childish and instead of melt into tear becaus i said that heathcliff wa now worthi of anyon s regard and it would honour the first gentleman in the countri to be hi friend he ought to have said it for me and been delight from sympathi he must get accustom to him and he mai as well like him consid how heathcliff ha reason to object to him i m sure he behav excel what do you think of hi go to wuther

inform concern me from you suppos you resid there still and joseph told hindlei who came out and fell to question him of what he had been do and how he had been live and final desir him to walk in there were some person sit at card heathcliff join them my brother lost some monei to him and find him plentifulli suppli he request that he would come again in the even to which he consent hindlei is too reckless to select hi acquaint prudent he doesn t troubl himself to reflect on the caus he might have for mistrust on whom he ha base injur but heathcliff affirm hi princip reason for resum a connect with hi ancient persecutor is a wish to instal himself in quarter at walk distanc from the grang and an attach to the hous where we live togeth and likewis a hope that i shall have more opportun of see him there than i could have if he settl in gimmerton he mean to offer liber payment for permiss to lodg at the height and doubtless my brother s covet will prompt him to accept the

forehead and a certain arch of the nostril that make her appear rather haughti whether she will or not with hareton the resembl is carri farther it is singular at all time then it wa particularli strike becaus hi sens were alert and hi mental faculti waken to unwont activ i suppos thi resembl disarm mr heathcliff he walk to the hearth in evid agit but it quickli subsid as he look at the young

i try to describ the thousand form of past associ and idea he awaken or embodi but you ll not talk of what i tell you and my mind is so etern seclud in itself it is tempt at last to turn it out to anoth five minut ago hareton seem a personif of my youth not a human be i felt to him in such a varieti of wai that it would have been imposs to have accost him ration in the first place hi startl like to catherin connect him fearfulli with her that howev which you mai suppos the most potent to arrest my imagin is actual the least for what is not connect with her to me and what doe not recal her i cannot look down to thi floor but her featur ar shape in the flag in everi cloud in everi tree fill the air at night and caught by glimps in everi object by dai i am surround with her imag the most ordinari face of men and women my own featur mock me with a resembl the entir world is a dread collect of memoranda that she did exist and that i have lost her well hareton s aspect wa the ghost of my immort love of my wild endeavour to hold my right my degrad my pride my happi and my anguish but it is frenzi to repeat these thought to you onli it will let you know why with a reluct to be alwai alon hi societi is no benefit rather an aggrav of the constant torment i suffer and it partli contribut to render me regardless how he and hi cousin go on togeth i can give them no attent ani more but what do you mean by a chang mr heathcliff i said alarm at hi manner though he wa neither in danger of lose hi sens nor dy accord to my judgment he wa quit strong and healthi and as to hi reason from childhood he had a delight in dwell on dark thing and entertain odd fanci he might have had a monomania on the subject of hi depart idol but on everi other point hi wit were as sound as mine i shall not know that till it come he said i m onli half consciou of it now you have no feel of ill have you i ask no nelli i have not he answer then you ar not afraid of death i pursu afraid no

there is scarc a black hair on my head and yet i cannot continu in thi condit i have to remind myself to breath almost to remind my heart to beat and it is like bend back a stiff spring it is by compuls that i do the slightest act not prompt by on thought and by compuls that i notic anyth aliv or dead which is not associ with on univers idea i have a singl wish and my whole be and faculti ar yearn to attain it thei have yearn toward it so long and so unwaveringli that i m convinc it will be reach and soon becaus it ha devour my exist i am swallow up in the anticip of it fulfil my confess have not reliev me but thei mai account for some otherwis unaccount phase of humour which i show o god it is a long fight i wish it were over he began to pace the room mutter terribl thing to himself till i wa inclin to believ as he said joseph did that conscienc had turn hi heart to an earthli hell i wonder greatli how it would end though he seldom befor had reveal thi state of mind even by look it wa hi habitu mood i had no doubt he assert it himself but not a soul from hi gener bear would have conjectur the fact you did not when you saw him mr lockwood and at the period of which i speak he wa just the same as then onli fonder of continu solitud and perhap still more lacon in compani chapter xxxiv for some dai after that even mr heathcliff shun meet us at meal yet he would not consent formal to exclud hareton and cathi he had an avers to yield so complet to hi feel choos rather to absent himself and eat onc in twenti four hour seem suffici susten for him on night after the famili were in bed i heard him go downstair and out at the front door i did not hear him re enter and in the morn i found he wa still awai we were in april then the weather wa sweet and warm the grass as green as shower and sun could make it and the two dwarf appl tree near the southern wall in full bloom after breakfast catherin insist on my bring a chair and sit with my work under the fir tree at the end of the hous and she beguil hareton who had perfectli recov from hi accid to dig and arrang her littl garden which wa shift to that corner by the influenc of joseph s complaint i wa comfort revel in the spring fragranc around and the beauti soft blue overhead when my young ladi who had run down near the gate to procur some primros root for a border return onli half laden and inform us that mr heathcliff wa come in and he spoke to me she ad with a perplex counten what did he sai ask hareton he told me to begon as fast as i could she answer but he look so differ from hi usual look that i stop a moment to stare at him how he inquir why almost bright and cheer no almost noth veri much excit and wild and glad she repli night walk amus him then i remark affect a careless manner in realiti as surpris as she wa and anxiou to ascertain the truth of her statement for to see the master look glad would not be an everi dai spectacl i frame an excus to go in heathcliff stood at the open door he wa pale and he trembl yet certainli he had a strang joy glitter in hi ey that alter the aspect of hi whole face will you have some breakfast i said you must be hungri rambl about all night i want to discov where he had been but i did not like to ask directli no i m not hungri he answer avert hi head and speak rather contemptu as if he guess i wa try to divin the occas of hi good humour i felt perplex i didn t know whether it were not a proper opportun to offer a bit of admonit i don t think it right to wander out of door i observ instead of be in bed it is not wise at ani rate thi moist season i daresai you ll catch a bad cold or a fever you have someth the matter with you now noth but what i can bear he repli and with the greatest pleasur provid you ll leav me alon get in and don t annoi me i obei and in pass i notic he breath as fast as a cat ye i reflect to myself we shall have a fit of ill i cannot conceiv what he ha been do that noon he sat down to dinner with us and receiv a heap up plate from my hand as if he intend to make amend for previou fast i ve neither cold nor fever nelli he remark in allus to my morn s speech and i m readi to do justic to the food you give me he took hi knife and fork and wa go to commenc eat when the inclin appear to becom suddenli extinct he laid them on the tabl look eagerli toward the window then rose and went out we saw him walk to and fro in the garden while we conclud our meal and earnshaw said he d go and ask why he would not dine he thought we had griev him some wai well is he come cri catherin when her cousin return nai he answer but he s not angri he seem rare pleas inde onli i made him impati by speak to him twice and then he bid me be off to you he wonder how i could want the compani of anybodi els i set hi plate to keep warm on the fender and after an hour or two he re enter when the room wa clear in no degre calmer the same unnatur it wa unnatur appear of joi under hi black brow the same bloodless hue and hi teeth visibl now and then in a kind of smile hi frame shiver not as on shiver with chill or weak but as a tight stretch cord vibrat a strong thrill rather than trembl i will ask what is the matter i thought or who should and i exclaim have you heard ani good new mr heathcliff you look uncommonli anim where should good new come from to me he said i m anim with hunger and seemingli i must not eat your dinner is here i return why won t you get it i don t want it now he mutter hastili i ll wait till supper and nelli onc for all let me beg you to warn hareton and the other awai from me i wish to be troubl by nobodi i wish to have thi place to myself is there some new reason for thi banish i inquir tell me why you ar so queer mr heathcliff where were you last night i m not put the question through idl curios but you ar put the question through veri idl curios he interrupt with a laugh yet i ll answer it last night i wa on the threshold of hell to dai i am within sight of my heaven i have my ey on it hardli three feet to sever me and now you d better go you ll neither see nor hear anyth to frighten you if you refrain from pry have swept the hearth and wipe the tabl i depart more perplex than ever he did not quit the hous again that afternoon and no on intrud on hi solitud till at eight o clock i deem it proper though unsummon to carri a candl and hi supper to him he wa lean against the ledg of an open lattic but not look out hi face wa turn to the interior gloom the fire had smoulder to ash the room wa fill with the damp mild air of the cloudi even and so still that not onli the murmur of the beck down gimmerton wa distinguish but it rippl and it gurgl over the pebbl or through the larg stone which it could not cover i utter an ejacul of discont at see the dismal grate and commenc shut the casement on after anoth till i came to hi must i close thi i ask in order to rous him for he would not stir the light flash on hi featur as i spoke oh mr lockwood i cannot express what a terribl start i got by the momentari view those deep black ey that smile and ghastli pale it appear to me not mr heathcliff but a goblin and in my terror i let the candl bend toward the wall and it left me in dark ye close it he repli in hi familiar voic there that is pure awkward why did you hold the candl horizont be quick and bring anoth i hurri out in a foolish state of dread and said to joseph the master wish you to take him a light and rekindl the fire for i dare not go in myself again just then joseph rattl some fire into the shovel and went but he brought it back immedi with the supper trai in hi other hand explain that mr heathcliff wa go to bed and he want noth to eat till morn we heard him mount the stair directli he did not proce to hi ordinari chamber but turn into that with the panel bed it window as i mention befor is wide enough for anybodi to get through and it struck me that he plot anoth midnight excurs of which he had rather we had no suspicion is he a ghoul or a vampir i muse i had read of such hideou incarn demon and then i set myself to reflect how i had tend him in infanc and watch him grow to youth and follow him almost through hi whole cours and what absurd nonsens it wa to yield to that sens of horror but where did he come from the littl dark thing harbour by a good man to hi bane mutter superstit as i doze into unconsci and i began half dream to weari myself with imagin some fit parentag for him and repeat my wake medit i track hi exist over again with grim variat at last pictur hi death and funer of which all i can rememb is be exceedingli vex at have the task of dictat an inscript for hi monument and consult the sexton about it and as he had no surnam and we could not tell hi ag we were oblig to content ourselv with the singl word heathcliff that came true we were if you enter the kirkyard you ll read on hi headston onli that and the date of hi death dawn restor me to common sens i rose and went into the garden as soon as i could see to ascertain if there were ani footmark under hi window there were none he ha stai at home i thought and he ll be all right to dai i prepar breakfast for the household as wa my usual custom but told hareton and catherin to get their er the master came down for he lai late thei prefer take it out of door under the tree and i set a littl tabl to accommod them on my re entranc i found mr heathcliff below he and joseph were convers about some farm busi he gave clear minut direct concern the matter discuss but he spoke rapidli and turn hi head continu asid and had the same excit express even more exagger when joseph quit the room he took hi seat in the place he gener chose and i put a basin of coffe befor him he drew it nearer and then rest hi arm on the tabl and look at the opposit wall as i suppos survei on particular portion up and down with glitter restless ey and with such eager interest that he stop breath dure half a minut togeth come now i exclaim push some bread against hi hand eat and drink that while it is hot it ha been wait near an hour he didn t notic me and yet he smile i d rather have seen him gnash hi teeth than smile so mr heathcliff master i cri don t for god s sake stare as if you saw an unearthli vision don t for god s sake shout so loud he repli turn round and tell me ar we by ourselv of cours wa my answer of cours we ar still i involuntarili obei him as if i wa not quit sure with a sweep of hi hand he clear a vacant space in front among the breakfast thing and leant forward to gaze more at hi eas now i perceiv he wa not look at the wall for when i regard him alon it seem exactli that he gaze at someth within two yard distanc and whatev it wa it commun appar both pleasur and pain in exquisit extrem at least the anguish yet raptur express of hi counten suggest that idea the fanci object wa not fix either hi ey pursu it with unweari dilig and even in speak to me were never wean awai i vainli remind him of hi protract abstin from food if he stir to touch anyth in complianc with my entreati if he stretch hi hand out to get a piec of bread hi finger clench befor thei reach it and remain on the tabl forget of their aim i sat a model of patienc try to attract hi absorb attent from it engross specul till he grew irrit and got up ask why i would not allow him to have hi own time in take hi meal and sai that on the next occas i needn t wait i might set the thing down and go have utter these word he left the hous slowli saunter down the garden path and disappear through the gate the hour crept anxious by anoth even came i did not retir to rest till late and when i did i could not sleep he return after midnight and instead of go to bed shut himself into the room beneath i listen and toss about and final dress and descend it wa too irksom to lie there harass my brain with a hundr idl misgiv i distinguish mr heathcliff s step restlessli measur the floor and he frequent broke the silenc by a deep inspir resembl a groan he mutter detach word also the onli on i could catch wa the name of catherin coupl with some wild term of endear or suffer and spoken as on would speak to a person present low and earnest and wrung from the depth of hi soul i had not courag to walk straight into the apart but i desir to divert him from hi reveri and therefor fell foul of the kitchen fire stir it and began to scrape the cinder it drew him forth sooner than i expect he open the door immedi and said nelli come here is it morn come in with your light it is strike four i answer you want a candl to take up stair you might have lit on at thi fire no i don t wish to go up stair he said come in and kindl me a fire and do anyth there is to do about the room i must blow the coal red first befor i can carri ani i repli get a chair and the bellow he roam to and fro meantim in a state approach distract hi heavi sigh succeed each other so thick as to leav no space for common breath between when dai break i ll send for green he said i wish to make some legal inquiri of him while i can bestow a thought on those matter and while i can act calmli i have not written my will yet and how to leav my properti i cannot determin i wish i could annihil it from the face of the earth i would not talk so mr heathcliff i interpos let your will be a while you ll be spare to repent of your mani injustic yet i never expect that your nerv would be disord thei ar at present marvel so howev and almost entir through your own fault the wai you ve pass these three last dai might knock up a titan do take some food and some repos you need onli look at yourself in a glass to see how you requir both your cheek ar hollow and your ey blood shot like a person starv with hunger and go blind with loss of sleep it is not my fault that i cannot eat or rest he repli i assur you it is through no settl design i ll do both as soon as i possibl can but you might as well bid a man struggl in the water rest within arm length of the shore i must reach it first and then i ll rest well never mind mr green as to repent of my injustic i ve done no injustic and i repent of noth i m too happi and yet i m not happi enough my soul s bliss kill my bodi but doe not satisfi itself happi master i cri strang happi if you would hear me without be angri i might offer some advic that would make you happier what is that he ask give it you ar awar mr heathcliff i said that from the time you were thirteen year old you have live a selfish unchristian life and probabl hardli had a bibl in your hand dure all that period you must have forgotten the content of the book and you mai not have space to search it now could it be hurt to send for some on some minist of ani denomin it doe not matter which to explain it and show you how veri far you have er from it precept and how unfit you will be for it heaven unless a chang take place befor you die i m rather oblig than angri nelli he said for you remind me of the manner in which i desir to be buri it is to be carri to the churchyard in the even you and hareton mai if you pleas accompani me and mind particularli to notic that the sexton obei my direct concern the two coffin no minist need come nor need anyth be said over me i tell you i have nearli attain my heaven and that of other is altogeth unvalu and uncovet by me and suppos you persev in your obstin fast and di by that mean and thei refus to buri you in the precinct of the kirk i said shock at hi godless indiffer how would you like it thei won t do that he repli if thei did you must have me remov secretli and if you neglect it you shall prove practic that the dead ar not annihil as soon as he heard the other member of the famili stir he retir to hi den and i breath freer but in the afternoon
