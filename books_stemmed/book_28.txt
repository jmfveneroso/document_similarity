a good famili though not of that countri my father be a foreign of bremen who settl first at hull he got a good estat by merchandis and leav off hi trade live afterward at york from whenc he had marri my mother whose relat were name robinson a veri good famili in that countri and from whom i wa call robinson kreutznaer but by the usual corrupt of word in england we ar now call nai we call ourselv and write our name cruso and so my companion alwai call me i had two elder brother on of whom wa lieuten colonel to an english regiment of foot in flander formerli command by the famou colonel lockhart and wa kill at the battl near dunkirk against the spaniard what becam of my second brother i never knew ani more than my father or mother knew what becam of me be the third son of the famili and not bred to ani trade my head began to be fill veri earli with rambl thought my father who wa veri ancient had given me a compet share of learn as far as hous educ and a countri free school gener go and design me for the law but i would be satisfi with noth but go to sea and my inclin to thi led me so strongli against the will nai the command of my father and against all the entreati and persuas of my mother and other friend that there seem to be someth fatal in that propens of natur tend directli to the life of miseri which wa to befal me my father a wise and grave man gave me seriou and excel counsel against what he foresaw wa my design he call me on morn into hi chamber where he wa confin by the gout and expostul veri warmli with me upon thi subject he ask me what reason more than a mere wander inclin i had for leav father s hous and my nativ countri where i might be well introduc and had a prospect of rais my fortun by applic and industri with a life of eas and pleasur he told me it wa men of desper fortun on on hand or of aspir superior fortun on the other who went abroad upon adventur to rise by enterpris and make themselv famou in undertak of a natur out of the common road that these thing were all either too far abov me or too far below me that mine wa the middl state or what might be call the upper station of low life which he had found by long experi wa the best state in the world the most suit to human happi not expos to the miseri and hardship the labour and suffer of the mechan part of mankind and not embarrass with the pride luxuri ambit and envi of the upper part of mankind he told me i might judg of the happi of thi state by thi on thing viz that thi wa the state of life which all other peopl envi that king have frequent lament the miser consequ of be born to great thing and wish thei had been place in the middl of the two extrem between the mean and the great that the wise man gave hi testimoni to thi as the standard of felic when he prai to have neither poverti nor rich he bade me observ it and i should alwai find that the calam of life were share among the upper and lower part of mankind but that the middl station had the fewest disast and wa not expos to so mani vicissitud as the higher or lower part of mankind nai thei were not subject to so mani distemp and uneasi either of bodi or mind as those were who by viciou live luxuri and extravag on the on hand or by hard labour want of necessari and mean or insuffici diet on the other hand bring distemp upon themselv by the natur consequ of their wai of live that the middl station of life wa calcul for all kind of virtu and all kind of enjoy that peac and plenti were the handmaid of a middl fortun that temper moder quiet health societi all agreeabl divers and all desir pleasur were the bless attend the middl station of life that thi wai men went silent and smoothli through the world and comfort out of it not embarrass with the labour of the hand or of the head not sold to a life of slaveri for daili bread nor harass with perplex circumst which rob the soul of peac and the bodi of rest nor enrag with the passion of envi or the secret burn lust of ambit for great thing but in easi circumst slide gentli through the world and sensibl tast the sweet of live without the bitter feel that thei ar happi and learn by everi dai s experi to know it more sensibl after thi he press me earnestli and in the most affection manner not to plai the young man nor to precipit myself into miseri which natur and the station of life i wa born in seem to have provid against that i wa under no necess of seek my bread that he would do well for me and endeavour to enter me fairli into the station of life which he had just been recommend to me and that if i wa not veri easi and happi in the world it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it and that he should have noth to answer for have thu discharg hi duti in warn me against measur which he knew would be to my hurt in a word that as he would do veri kind thing for me if i would stai and settl at home as he direct so he would not have so much hand in my misfortun as to give me ani encourag to go awai and to close all he told me i had my elder brother for an exampl to whom he had us the same earnest persuas to keep him from go into the low countri war but could not prevail hi young desir prompt him to run into the armi where he wa kill and though he said he would not ceas to prai for me yet he would ventur to sai to me that if i did take thi foolish step god would not bless me and i should have leisur hereaft to reflect upon have neglect hi counsel when there might be none to assist in my recoveri i observ in thi last part of hi discours which wa truli prophet though i suppos my father did not know it to be so himself i sai i observ the tear run down hi face veri plentifulli especi when he spoke of my brother who wa kill and that when he spoke of my have leisur to repent and none to assist me he wa so move that he broke off the discours and told me hi heart wa so full he could sai no more to me i wa sincer affect with thi discours and inde who could be otherwis and i resolv not to think of go abroad ani more but to settl at home accord to my father s desir but ala a few dai wore it all off and in short to prevent ani of my father s further importun in a few week after i resolv to run quit awai from him howev i did not act quit so hastili as the first heat of my resolut prompt but i took my mother at a time when i thought her a littl more pleasant than ordinari and told her that my thought were so entir bent upon see the world that i should never settl to anyth with resolut enough to go through with it and my father had better give me hi consent than forc me to go without it that i wa now eighteen year old which wa too late to go apprentic to a trade or clerk to an attornei that i wa sure if i did i should never serv out my time but i should certainli run awai from my master befor my time wa out and go to sea and if she would speak to my father to let me go on voyag abroad if i came home again and did not like it i would go no more and i would promis by a doubl dilig to recov the time that i had lost thi put my mother into a great passion she told me she knew it would be to no purpos to speak to my father upon ani such subject that he knew too well what wa my interest to give hi consent to anyth so much for my hurt and that she wonder how i could think of ani such thing after the discours i had had with my father and such kind and tender express as she knew my father had us to me and that in short if i would ruin myself there wa no help for me but i might depend i should never have their consent to it that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruct and i should never have it to sai that my mother wa will when my father wa not though my mother refus to move it to my father yet i heard afterward that she report all the discours to him and that my father after show a great concern at it said to her with a sigh that boi might be happi if he would stai at home but if he goe abroad he will be the most miser wretch that ever wa born i can give no consent to it it wa not till almost a year after thi that i broke loos though in the meantim i continu obstin deaf to all propos of settl to busi and frequent expostul with my father and mother about their be so posit determin against what thei knew my inclin prompt me to but be on dai at hull where i went casual and without ani purpos of make an elop at that time but i sai be there and on of my companion be about to sail to london in hi father s ship and prompt me to go with them with the common allur of seafar men that it should cost me noth for my passag i consult neither father nor mother ani more nor so much as sent them word of it but leav them to hear of it as thei might without ask god s bless or my father s without ani consider of circumst or consequ and in an ill hour god know on the st of septemb i went on board a ship bound for london never ani young adventur s misfortun i believ began sooner or continu longer than mine the ship wa no sooner out of the humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most fright manner and as i had never been at sea befor i wa most inexpress sick in bodi and terrifi in mind i began now serious to reflect upon what i had done and how justli i wa overtaken by the judgment of heaven for my wick leav my father s hous and abandon my duti all the good counsel of my parent my father s tear and my mother s entreati came now fresh into my mind and my conscienc which wa not yet come to the pitch of hard to which it ha sinc reproach me with the contempt of advic and the breach of my duti to god and my father all thi while the storm increas and the sea went veri high though noth like what i have seen mani time sinc no nor what i saw a few dai after but it wa enough to affect me then who wa but a young sailor and had never known anyth of the matter i expect everi wave would have swallow us up and that everi time the ship fell down as i thought it did in the trough or hollow of the sea we should never rise more in thi agoni of mind i made mani vow and resolut that if it would pleas god to spare my life in thi on voyag if ever i got onc my foot upon dry land again i would go directli home to my father and never set it into a ship again while i live that i would take hi advic and never run myself into such miseri as these ani more now i saw plainli the good of hi observ about the middl station of life how easi how comfort he had live all hi dai and never had been expos to tempest at sea or troubl on shore and i resolv that i would like a true repent prodig go home to my father these wise and sober thought continu all the while the storm last and inde some time after but the next dai the wind wa abat and the sea calmer and i began to be a littl inur to it howev i wa veri grave for all that dai be also a littl sea sick still but toward night the weather clear up the wind wa quit over and a charm fine even follow the sun went down perfectli clear and rose so the next morn and have littl or no wind and a smooth sea the sun shine upon it the sight wa as i thought the most delight that ever i saw i had slept well in the night and wa now no more sea sick but veri cheer look with wonder upon the sea that wa so rough and terribl the dai befor and could be so calm and so pleasant in so littl a time after and now lest my good resolut should continu my companion who had entic me awai come to me well bob sai he clap me upon the shoulder how do you do after it i warrant you were fright wer n t you last night when it blew but a cap of wind a cap d you call it said i twa a terribl storm a storm you fool you repli he do you call that a storm why it wa noth at all give us but a good ship and sea room and we think noth of such a squall of wind as that but you re but a fresh water sailor bob come let us make a bowl of punch and we ll forget all that d ye see what charm weather ti now to make short thi sad part of my stori we went the wai of all sailor the punch wa made and i wa made half drunk with it and in that on night s wicked i drown all my repent all my reflect upon my past conduct all my resolut for the futur in a word as the sea wa return to it smooth of surfac and settl calm by the abat of that storm so the hurri of my thought be over my fear and apprehens of be swallow up by the sea be forgotten and the current of my former desir return i entir forgot the vow and promis that i made in my distress i found inde some interv of reflect and the seriou thought did as it were endeavour to return again sometim but i shook them off and rous myself from them as it were from a distemp and appli myself to drink and compani soon master the return of those fit for so i call them and i had in five or six dai got as complet a victori over conscienc as ani young fellow that resolv not to be troubl with it could desir but i wa to have anoth trial for it still and provid as in such case gener it doe resolv to leav me entir without excus for if i would not take thi for a deliver the next wa to be such a on as the worst and most harden wretch among us would confess both the danger and the merci of the sixth dai of our be at sea we came into yarmouth road the wind have been contrari and the weather calm we had made but littl wai sinc the storm here we were oblig to come to an anchor and here we lai the wind continu contrari viz at south west for seven or eight dai dure which time a great mani ship from newcastl came into the same road as the common harbour where the ship might wait for a wind for the river we had not howev rid here so long but we should have tide it up the river but that the wind blew too fresh and after we had lain four or five dai blew veri hard howev the road be reckon as good as a harbour the anchorag good and our ground tackl veri strong our men were unconcern and not in the least apprehens of danger but spent the time in rest and mirth after the manner of the sea but the eighth dai in the morn the wind increas and we had all hand at work to strike our topmast and make everyth snug and close that the ship might ride as easi as possibl by noon the sea went veri high inde and our ship rode forecastl in ship sever sea and we thought onc or twice our anchor had come home upon which our master order out the sheet anchor so that we rode with two anchor ahead and the cabl veer out to the bitter end by thi time it blew a terribl storm inde and now i began to see terror and amaz in the face even of the seamen themselv the master though vigil in the busi of preserv the ship yet as he went in and out of hi cabin by me i could hear him softli to himself sai sever time lord be merci to us we shall be all lost we shall be all undon and the like dure these first hurri i wa stupid ly still in my cabin which wa in the steerag and cannot describ my temper i could ill resum the first penit which i had so appar trampl upon and harden myself against i thought the bitter of death had been past and that thi would be noth like the first but when the master himself came by me as i said just now and said we should be all lost i wa dreadfulli fright i got up out of my cabin and look out but such a dismal sight i never saw the sea ran mountain high and broke upon us everi three or four minut when i could look about i could see noth but distress round us two ship that rode near us we found had cut their mast by the board be deep laden and our men cri out that a ship which rode about a mile ahead of us wa founder two more ship be driven from their anchor were run out of the road to sea at all adventur and that with not a mast stand the light ship fare the best as not so much labour in the sea but two or three of them drove and came close by us run awai with onli their spritsail out befor the wind toward even the mate and boatswain beg the master of our ship to let them cut awai the fore mast which he wa veri unwil to do but the boatswain protest to him that if he did not the ship would founder he consent and when thei had cut awai the fore mast the main mast stood so loos and shook the ship so much thei were oblig to cut that awai also and make a clear deck ani on mai judg what a condit i must be in at all thi who wa but a young sailor and who had been in such a fright befor at but a littl but if i can express at thi distanc the thought i had about me at that time i wa in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former convict and the have return from them to the resolut i had wickedli taken at first than i wa at death itself and these ad to the terror of the storm put me into such a condit that i can by no word describ it but the worst wa not come yet the storm continu with such furi that the seamen themselv acknowledg thei had never seen a wors we had a good ship but she wa deep laden and wallow in the sea so that the seamen everi now and then cri out she would founder it wa my advantag in on respect that i did not know what thei meant by founder till i inquir howev the storm wa so violent that i saw what is not often seen the master the boatswain and some other more sensibl than the rest at their prayer and expect everi moment when the ship would go to the bottom in the middl of the night and under all the rest of our distress on of the men that had been down to see cri out we had sprung a leak anoth said there wa four feet water in the hold then all hand were call to the pump at that word my heart as i thought di within me and i fell backward upon the side of my bed where i sat into the cabin howev the men rous me and told me that i that wa abl to do noth befor wa as well abl to pump as anoth at which i stir up and went to the pump and work veri heartili while thi wa do the master see some light collier who not abl to ride out the storm were oblig to slip and run awai to sea and would come near us order to fire a gun as a signal of distress i who knew noth what thei meant thought the ship had broken or some dread thing happen in a word i wa so surpris that i fell down in a swoon as thi wa a time when everybodi had hi own life to think of nobodi mind me or what wa becom of me but anoth man step up to the pump and thrust me asid with hi foot let me lie think i had been dead and it wa a great while befor i came to myself we work on but the water increas in the hold it wa appar that the ship would founder and though the storm began to abat a littl yet it wa not possibl she could swim till we might run into ani port so the master continu fire gun for help and a light ship who had rid it out just ahead of us ventur a boat out to help us it wa with the utmost hazard the boat came near us but it wa imposs for us to get on board or for the boat to lie near the ship s side till at last the men row veri heartili and ventur their live to save our our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoi to it and then veer it out a great length which thei after much labour and hazard took hold of and we haul them close under our stern and got all into their boat it wa to no purpos for them or us after we were in the boat to think of reach their own ship so all agre to let her drive and onli to pull her in toward shore as much as we could and our master promis them that if the boat wa stave upon shore he would make it good to their master so partli row and partli drive our boat went awai to the northward slope toward the shore almost as far as winterton ness we were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we saw her sink and then i understood for the first time what wa meant by a ship founder in the sea i must acknowledg i had hardli ey to look up when the seamen told me she wa sink for from the moment that thei rather put me into the boat than that i might be said to go in my heart wa as it were dead within me partli with fright partli with horror of mind and the thought of what wa yet befor me while we were in thi condit the men yet labour at the oar to bring the boat near the shore we could see when our boat mount the wave we were abl to see the shore a great mani peopl run along the strand to assist us when we should come near but we made but slow wai toward the shore nor were we abl to reach the shore till be past the lighthous at winterton the shore fall off to the westward toward cromer and so the land broke off a littl the violenc of the wind here we got in and though not without much difficulti got all safe on shore and walk afterward on foot to yarmouth where as unfortun men we were us with great human as well by the magistr of the town who assign us good quarter as by particular merchant and owner of ship and had monei given us suffici to carri us either to london or back to hull as we thought fit had i now had the sens to have gone back to hull and have gone home i had been happi and my father as in our bless saviour s parabl had even kill the fat calf for me for hear the ship i went awai in wa cast awai in yarmouth road it wa a great while befor he had ani assur that i wa not drown but my ill fate push me on now with an obstinaci that noth could resist and though i had sever time loud call from my reason and my more compos judgment to go home yet i had no power to do it i know not what to call thi nor will i urg that it is a secret overrul decre that hurri us on to be the instrument of our own destruct even though it be befor us and that we rush upon it with our ey open certainli noth but some such decre unavoid miseri which it wa imposs for me to escap could have push me forward against the calm reason and persuas of my most retir thought and against two such visibl instruct as i had met with in my first attempt my comrad who had help to harden me befor and who wa the master s son wa now less forward than i the first time he spoke to me after we were at yarmouth which wa not till two or three dai for we were separ in the town to sever quarter i sai the first time he saw me it appear hi tone wa alter and look veri melancholi and shake hi head he ask me how i did and tell hi father who i wa and how i had come thi voyag onli for a trial in order to go further abroad hi father turn to me with a veri grave and concern tone young man sai he you ought never to go to sea ani more you ought to take thi for a plain and visibl token that you ar not to be a seafar man why sir said i will you go to sea no more that is anoth case said he it is my call and therefor my duti but as you made thi voyag on trial you see what a tast heaven ha given you of what you ar to expect if you persist perhap thi ha all befallen us on your account like jonah in the ship of tarshish prai continu he what ar you and on what account did you go to sea upon that i told him some of my stori at the end of which he burst out into a strang kind of passion what had i done sai he that such an unhappi wretch should come into my ship i would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pound thi inde wa as i said an excurs of hi spirit which were yet agit by the sens of hi loss and wa farther than he could have author to go howev he afterward talk veri grave to me exhort me to go back to my father and not tempt provid to my ruin tell me i might see a visibl hand of heaven against me and young man said he depend upon it if you do not go back wherev you go you will meet with noth but disast and disappoint till your father s word ar fulfil upon you we part soon after for i made him littl answer and i saw him no more which wai he went i knew not as for me have some monei in my pocket i travel to london by land and there as well as on the road had mani struggl with myself what cours of life i should take and whether i should go home or to sea as to go home shame oppos the best motion that offer to my thought and it immedi occur to me how i should be laugh at among the neighbour and should be asham to see not my father and mother onli but even everybodi els from whenc i have sinc often observ how incongru and irrat the common temper of mankind is especi of youth to that reason which ought to guid them in such case viz that thei ar not asham to sin and yet ar asham to repent not asham of the action for which thei ought justli to be esteem fool but ar asham of the return which onli can make them be esteem wise men in thi state of life howev i remain some time uncertain what measur to take and what cours of life to lead an irresist reluct continu to go home and as i stai awai a while the remembr of the distress i had been in wore off and as that abat the littl motion i had in my desir to return wore off with it till at last i quit laid asid the thought of it and look out for a voyag chapter ii slaveri and escap that evil influenc which carri me first awai from my father s hous which hurri me into the wild and indigest notion of rais my fortun and that impress those conceit so forcibl upon me as to make me deaf to all good advic and to the entreati and even the command of my father i sai the same influenc whatev it wa present the most unfortun of all enterpris to my view and i went on board a vessel bound to the coast of africa or as our sailor vulgarli call it a voyag to guinea it wa my great misfortun that in all these adventur i did not ship myself as a sailor when though i might inde have work a littl harder than ordinari yet at the same time i should have learnt the duti and offic of a fore mast man and in time might have qualifi myself for a mate or lieuten if not for a master but as it wa alwai my fate to choos for the wors so i did here for have monei in my pocket and good cloth upon my back i would alwai go on board in the habit of a gentleman and so i neither had ani busi in the ship nor learn to do ani it wa my lot first of all to fall into pretti good compani in london which doe not alwai happen to such loos and misguid young fellow as i then wa the devil gener not omit to lai some snare for them veri earli but it wa not so with me i first got acquaint with the master of a ship who had been on the coast of guinea and who have had veri good success there wa resolv to go again thi captain take a fanci to my convers which wa not at all disagre at that time hear me sai i had a mind to see the world told me if i would go the voyag with him i should be at no expens i should be hi messmat and hi companion and if i could carri anyth with me i should have all the advantag of it that the trade would admit and perhap i might meet with some encourag i embrac the offer and enter into a strict friendship with thi captain who wa an honest plain deal man i went the voyag with him and carri a small adventur with me which by the disinterest honesti of my friend the captain i increas veri consider for i carri about in such toi and trifl as the captain direct me to bui these i had muster togeth by the assist of some of my relat whom i correspond with and who i believ got my father or at least my mother to contribut so much as that to my first adventur thi wa the onli voyag which i mai sai wa success in all my adventur which i ow to the integr and honesti of my friend the captain under whom also i got a compet knowledg of the mathemat and the rule of navig learn how to keep an account of the ship s cours take an observ and in short to understand some thing that were need to be understood by a sailor for as he took delight to instruct me i took delight to learn and in a word thi voyag made me both a sailor and a merchant for i brought home five pound nine ounc of gold dust for my adventur which yield me in london at my return almost and thi fill me with those aspir thought which have sinc so complet my ruin yet even in thi voyag i had my misfortun too particularli that i wa continu sick be thrown into a violent calentur by the excess heat of the climat our princip trade be upon the coast from latitud of degre north even to the line itself i wa now set up for a guinea trader and my friend to my great misfortun dy soon after hi arriv i resolv to go the same voyag again and i embark in the same vessel with on who wa hi mate in the former voyag and had now got the command of the ship thi wa the unhappiest voyag that ever man made for though i did not carri quit of my new gain wealth so that i had left which i had lodg with my friend s widow who wa veri just to me yet i fell into terribl misfortun the first wa thi our ship make her cours toward the canari island or rather between those island and the african shore wa surpris in the grei of the morn by a turkish rover of salle who gave chase to us with all the sail she could make we crowd also as much canva as our yard would spread or our mast carri to get clear but find the pirat gain upon us and would certainli come up with us in a few hour we prepar to fight our ship have twelv gun and the rogu eighteen about three in the afternoon he came up with us and bring to by mistak just athwart our quarter instead of athwart our stern as he intend we brought eight of our gun to bear on that side and pour in a broadsid upon him which made him sheer off again after return our fire and pour in also hi small shot from near two hundr men which he had on board howev we had not a man touch all our men keep close he prepar to attack us again and we to defend ourselv but lai us on board the next time upon our other quarter he enter sixti men upon our deck who immedi fell to cut and hack the sail and rig we pli them with small shot half pike powder chest and such like and clear our deck of them twice howev to cut short thi melancholi part of our stori our ship be disabl and three of our men kill and eight wound we were oblig to yield and were carri all prison into salle a port belong to the moor the usag i had there wa not so dread as at first i apprehend nor wa i carri up the countri to the emperor s court as the rest of our men were but wa kept by the captain of the rover as hi proper prize and made hi slave be young and nimbl and fit for hi busi at thi surpris chang of my circumst from a merchant to a miser slave i wa perfectli overwhelm and now i look back upon my father s prophet discours to me that i should be miser and have none to reliev me which i thought wa now so effectu brought to pass that i could not be wors for now the hand of heaven had overtaken me and i wa undon without redempt but ala thi wa but a tast of the miseri i wa to go through as will appear in the sequel of thi stori as my new patron or master had taken me home to hi hous so i wa in hope that he would take me with him when he went to sea again believ that it would some time or other be hi fate to be taken by a spanish or portug man of war and that then i should be set at liberti but thi hope of mine wa soon taken awai for when he went to sea he left me on shore to look after hi littl garden and do the common drudgeri of slave about hi hous and when he came home again from hi cruis he order me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship here i medit noth but my escap and what method i might take to effect it but found no wai that had the least probabl in it noth present to make the supposit of it ration for i had nobodi to commun it to that would embark with me no fellow slave no englishman irishman or scotchman there but myself so that for two year though i often pleas myself with the imagin yet i never had the least encourag prospect of put it in practic after about two year an odd circumst present itself which put the old thought of make some attempt for my liberti again in my head my patron ly at home longer than usual without fit out hi ship which as i heard wa for want of monei he us constantli onc or twice a week sometim often if the weather wa fair to take the ship s pinnac and go out into the road a fish and as he alwai took me and young maresco with him to row the boat we made him veri merri and i prove veri dexter in catch fish insomuch that sometim he would send me with a moor on of hi kinsmen and the youth the maresco as thei call him to catch a dish of fish for him it happen on time that go a fish in a calm morn a fog rose so thick that though we were not half a leagu from the shore we lost sight of it and row we knew not whither or which wai we labour all dai and all the next night and when the morn came we found we had pull off to sea instead of pull in for the shore and that we were at least two leagu from the shore howev we got well in again though with a great deal of labour and some danger for the wind began to blow pretti fresh in the morn but we were all veri hungri but our patron warn by thi disast resolv to take more care of himself for the futur and have ly by him the longboat of our english ship that he had taken he resolv he would not go a fish ani more without a compass and some provis so he order the carpent of hi ship who also wa an english slave to build a littl state room or cabin in the middl of the long boat like that of a barg with a place to stand behind it to steer and haul home the main sheet the room befor for a hand or two to stand and work the sail she sail with what we call a shoulder of mutton sail and the boom jibe over the top of the cabin which lai veri snug and low and had in it room for him to lie with a slave or two and a tabl to eat on with some small locker to put in some bottl of such liquor as he thought fit to drink and hi bread rice and coffe we went frequent out with thi boat a fish and as i wa most dexter to catch fish for him he never went without me it happen that he had appoint to go out in thi boat either for pleasur or for fish with two or three moor of some distinct in that place and for whom he had provid extraordinarili and had therefor sent on board the boat overnight a larger store of provis than ordinari and had order me to get readi three fuse with powder and shot which were on board hi ship for that thei design some sport of fowl as well as fish i got all thing readi as he had direct and wait the next morn with the boat wash clean her ancient and pendant out and everyth to accommod hi guest when by and by my patron came on board alon and told me hi guest had put off go from some busi that fell out and order me with the man and boi as usual to go out with the boat and catch them some fish for that hi friend were to sup at hi hous and command that as soon as i got some fish i should bring it home to hi hous all which i prepar to do thi moment my former notion of deliver dart into my thought for now i found i wa like to have a littl ship at my command and my master be gone i prepar to furnish myself not for fish busi but for a voyag though i knew not neither did i so much as consid whither i should steer anywher to get out of that place wa my desir my first contriv wa to make a pretenc to speak to thi moor to get someth for our subsist on board for i told him we must not presum to eat of our patron s bread he said that wa true so he brought a larg basket of rusk or biscuit and three jar of fresh water into the boat i knew where my patron s case of bottl stood which it wa evid by the make were taken out of some english prize and i convei them into the boat while the moor wa on shore as if thei had been there befor for our master i convei also a great lump of beeswax into the boat which weigh about half a hundr weight with a parcel of twine or thread a hatchet a saw and a hammer all of which were of great us to us afterward especi the wax to make candl anoth trick i tri upon him which he innoc came into also hi name wa ismael which thei call mulei or moeli so i call to him moeli said i our patron s gun ar on board the boat can you not get a littl powder and shot it mai be we mai kill some alcami a fowl like our curlew for ourselv for i know he keep the gunner s store in the ship ye sai he i ll bring some and accordingli he brought a great leather pouch which held a pound and a half of powder or rather more and anoth with shot that had five or six pound with some bullet and put all into the boat at the same time i had found some powder of my master s in the great cabin with which i fill on of the larg bottl in the case which wa almost empti pour what wa in it into anoth and thu furnish with everyth need we sail out of the port to fish the castl which is at the entranc of the port knew who we were and took no notic of us and we were not abov a mile out of the port befor we haul in our sail and set us down to fish the wind blew from the n n e which wa contrari to my desir for had it blown southerli i had been sure to have made the coast of spain and at least reach to the bai of cadiz but my resolut were blow which wai it would i would be gone from that horrid place where i wa and leav the rest to fate after we had fish some time and caught noth for when i had fish on my hook i would not pull them up that he might not see them i said to the moor thi will not do our master will not be thu serv we must stand farther off he think no harm agre and be in the head of the boat set the sail and as i had the helm i ran the boat out near a leagu farther and then brought her to as if i would fish when give the boi the helm i step forward to where the moor wa and make as if i stoop for someth behind him i took him by surpris with my arm under hi waist and toss him clear overboard into the sea he rose immedi for he swam like a cork and call to me beg to be taken in told me he would go all over the world with me he swam so strong after the boat that he would have reach me veri quickli there be but littl wind upon which i step into the cabin and fetch on of the fowl piec i present it at him and told him i had done him no hurt and if he would be quiet i would do him none but said i you swim well enough to reach to the shore and the sea is calm make the best of your wai to shore and i will do you no harm but if you come near the boat i ll shoot you through the head for i am resolv to have my liberti so he turn himself about and swam for the shore and i make no doubt but he reach it with eas for he wa an excel swimmer i could have been content to have taken thi moor with me and have drown the boi but there wa no ventur to trust him when he wa gone i turn to the boi whom thei call xuri and said to him xuri if you will be faith to me i ll make you a great man but if you will not stroke your face to be true to me that is swear by mahomet and hi father s beard i must throw you into the sea too the boi smile in my face and spoke so innoc that i could not distrust him and swore to be faith to me and go all over the world with me while i wa in view of the moor that wa swim i stood out directli to sea with the boat rather stretch to windward that thei might think me gone toward the strait mouth as inde ani on that had been in their wit must have been suppos to do for who would have suppos we were sail on to the southward to the truli barbarian coast where whole nation of negro were sure to surround us with their cano and destroi us where we could not go on shore but we should be devour by savag beast or more merciless savag of human kind but as soon as it grew dusk in the even i chang my cours and steer directli south and by east bend my cours a littl toward the east that i might keep in with the shore and have a fair fresh gale of wind and a smooth quiet sea i made such sail that i believ by the next dai at three o clock in the afternoon when i first made the land i could not be less than on hundr and fifti mile south of salle quit beyond the emperor of morocco s dominion or inde of ani other king thereabout for we saw no peopl yet such wa the fright i had taken of the moor and the dread apprehens i had of fall into their hand that i would not stop or go on shore or come to an anchor the wind continu fair till i had sail in that manner five dai and then the wind shift to the southward i conclud also that if ani of our vessel were in chase of me thei also would now give over so i ventur to make to the coast and came to an anchor in the mouth of a littl river i knew not what nor where neither what latitud what countri what nation or what river i neither saw nor desir to see ani peopl the princip thing i want wa fresh water we came into thi creek in the even resolv to swim on shore as soon as it wa dark and discov the countri but as soon as it wa quit dark we heard such dread nois of the bark roar and howl of wild creatur of we knew not what kind that the poor boi wa readi to die with fear and beg of me not to go on shore till dai well xuri said i then i won t but it mai be that we mai see men by dai who will be as bad to us as those lion then we give them the shoot gun sai xuri laugh make them run wei such english xuri spoke by convers among us slave howev i wa glad to see the boi so cheer and i gave him a dram out of our patron s case of bottl to cheer him up after all xuri s advic wa good and i took it we drop our littl anchor and lai still all night i sai still for we slept none for in two or three hour we saw vast great creatur we knew not what to call them of mani sort come down to the sea shore and run into the water wallow and wash themselv for the pleasur of cool themselv and thei made such hideou howl and yell that i never inde heard the like xuri wa dreadfulli fright and inde so wa i too but we were both more fright when we heard on of these mighti creatur come swim toward our boat we could not see him but we might hear him by hi blow to be a monstrou huge and furiou beast xuri said it wa a lion and it might be so for aught i know but poor xuri cri to me to weigh the anchor and row awai no sai i xuri we can slip our cabl with the buoi to it and go off to sea thei cannot follow us far i had no sooner said so but i perceiv the creatur whatev it wa within two oar length which someth surpris me howev i immedi step to the cabin door and take up my gun fire at him upon which he immedi turn about and swam toward the shore again but it is imposs to describ the horrid nois and hideou cri and howl that were rais as well upon the edg of the shore as higher within the countri upon the nois or report of the gun a thing i have some reason to believ those creatur had never heard befor thi convinc me that there wa no go on shore for us in the night on that coast and how to ventur on shore in the dai wa anoth question too for to have fallen into the hand of ani of the savag had been as bad as to have fallen into the hand of the lion and tiger at least we were equal apprehens of the danger of it be that as it would we were oblig to go on shore somewher or other for water for we had not a pint left in the boat when and where to get to it wa the point xuri said if i would let him go on shore with on of the jar he would find if there wa ani water and bring some to me i ask him why he would go why i should not go and he stai in the boat the boi answer with so much affect as made me love him ever after sai he if wild man come thei eat me you go wei well xuri said i we will both go and if the wild man come we will kill them thei shall eat neither of us so i gave xuri a piec of rusk bread to eat and a dram out of our patron s case of bottl which i mention befor and we haul the boat in as near the shore as we thought wa proper and so wade on shore carri noth but our arm and two jar for water i did not care to go out of sight of the boat fear the come of cano with savag down the river but the boi see a low place about a mile up the countri rambl to it and by and by i saw him come run toward me i thought he wa pursu by some savag or fright with some wild beast and i ran forward toward him to help him but when i came nearer to him i saw someth hang over hi shoulder which wa a creatur that he had shot like a hare but differ in colour and longer leg howev we were veri glad of it and it wa veri good meat but the great joi that poor xuri came with wa to tell me he had found good water and seen no wild man but we found afterward that we need not take such pain for water for a littl higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh when the tide wa out which flow but a littl wai up so we fill our jar and feast on the hare he had kill and prepar to go on our wai have seen no footstep of ani human creatur in that part of the countri as i had been on voyag to thi coast befor i knew veri well that the island of the canari and the cape de verd island also lai not far off from the coast but as i had no instrument to take an observ to know what latitud we were in and not exactli know or at least rememb what latitud thei were in i knew not where to look for them or when to stand off to sea toward them otherwis i might now easili have found some of these island but my hope wa that if i stood along thi coast till i came to that part where the english trade i should find some of their vessel upon their usual design of trade that would reliev and take us in by the best of my calcul that place where i now wa must be that countri which ly between the emperor of morocco s dominion and the negro li wast and uninhabit except by wild beast the negro have abandon it and gone farther south for fear of the moor and the moor not think it worth inhabit by reason of it barren and inde both forsak it becaus of the prodigi number of tiger lion leopard and other furiou creatur which harbour there so that the moor us it for their hunt onli where thei go like an armi two or three thousand men at a time and inde for near a hundr mile togeth upon thi coast we saw noth but a wast uninhabit countri by dai and heard noth but howl and roar of wild beast by night onc or twice in the daytim i thought i saw the pico of teneriff be the high top of the mountain teneriff in the canari and had a great mind to ventur out in hope of reach thither but have tri twice i wa forc in again by contrari wind the sea also go too high for my littl vessel so i resolv to pursu my first design and keep along the shore sever time i wa oblig to land for fresh water after we had left thi place and onc in particular be earli in morn we came to an anchor under a littl point of land which wa pretti high and the tide begin to flow we lai still to go farther in xuri whose ey were more about him than it seem mine were call softli to me and tell me that we had best go farther off the shore for sai he look yonder li a dread monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep i look where he point and saw a dread monster inde for it wa a terribl great lion that lai on the side of the shore under the shade of a piec of the hill that hung as it were a littl over him xuri sai i you shall on shore and kill him xuri look fright and said me kill he eat me at on mouth on mouth he meant howev i said no more to the boi but bade him lie still and i took our biggest gun which wa almost musket bore and load it with a good charg of powder and with two slug and laid it down then i load anoth gun with two bullet and the third for we had three piec i load with five smaller bullet i took the best aim i could with the first piec to have shot him in the head but he lai so with hi leg rais a littl abov hi nose that the slug hit hi leg about the knee and broke the bone he start up growl at first but find hi leg broken fell down again and then got upon three leg and gave the most hideou roar that ever i heard i wa a littl surpris that i had not hit him on the head howev i took up the second piec immedi and though he began to move off fire again and shot him in the head and had the pleasur to see him drop and make but littl nois but lie struggl for life then xuri took heart and would have me let him go on shore well go said i so the boi jump into the water and take a littl gun in on hand swam to shore with the other hand and come close to the creatur put the muzzl of the piec to hi ear and shot him in the head again which despatch him quit thi wa game inde to us but thi wa no food and i wa veri sorri to lose three charg of powder and shot upon a creatur that wa good for noth to us howev xuri said he would have some of him so he come on board and ask me to give him the hatchet for what xuri said i me cut off hi head said he howev xuri could not cut off hi head but he cut off a foot and brought it with him and it wa a monstrou great on i bethought myself howev that perhap the skin of him might on wai or other be of some valu to us and i resolv to take off hi skin if i could so xuri and i went to work with him but xuri wa much the better workman at it for i knew veri ill how to do it inde it took us both up the whole dai but at last we got off the hide of him and spread it on the top of our cabin the sun effectu dri it in two dai time and it afterward serv me to lie upon chapter iii wreck on a desert island after thi stop we made on to the southward continu for ten or twelv dai live veri sparingli on our provis which began to abat veri much and go no often to the shore than we were oblig to for fresh water my design in thi wa to make the river gambia or seneg that is to sai anywher about the cape de verd where i wa in hope to meet with some european ship and if i did not i knew not what cours i had to take but to seek for the island or perish there among the negro i knew that all the ship from europ which sail either to the coast of guinea or to brazil or to the east indi made thi cape or those island and in a word i put the whole of my fortun upon thi singl point either that i must meet with some ship or must perish when i had pursu thi resolut about ten dai longer as i have said i began to see that the land wa inhabit and in two or three place as we sail by we saw peopl stand upon the shore to look at us we could also perceiv thei were quit black and nake i wa onc inclin to have gone on shore to them but xuri wa my better counsellor and said to me no go no go howev i haul in nearer the shore that i might talk to them and i found thei ran along the shore by me a good wai i observ thei had no weapon in their hand except on who had a long slender stick which xuri said wa a lanc and that thei could throw them a great wai with good aim so i kept at a distanc but talk with them by sign as well as i could and particularli made sign for someth to eat thei beckon to me to stop my boat and thei would fetch me some meat upon thi i lower the top of my sail and lai by and two of them ran up into the countri and in less than half an hour came back and brought with them two piec of dri flesh and some corn such as is the produc of their countri but we neither knew what the on or the other wa howev we were will to accept it but how to come at it wa our next disput for i would not ventur on shore to them and thei were as much afraid of us but thei took a safe wai for us all for thei brought it to the shore and laid it down and went and stood a great wai off till we fetch it on board and then came close to us again we made sign of thank to them for we had noth to make them amend but an opportun offer that veri instant to oblig them wonderfulli for while we were ly by the shore came two mighti creatur on pursu the other as we took it with great furi from the mountain toward the sea whether it wa the male pursu the femal or whether thei were in sport or in rage we could not tell ani more than we could tell whether it wa usual or strang but i believ it wa the latter becaus in the first place those raven creatur seldom appear but in the night and in the second place we found the peopl terribl fright especi the women the man that had the lanc or dart did not fly from them but the rest did howev as the two creatur ran directli into the water thei did not offer to fall upon ani of the negro but plung themselv into the sea and swam about as if thei had come for their divers at last on of them began to come nearer our boat than at first i expect but i lai readi for him for i had load my gun with all possibl expedit and bade xuri load both the other as soon as he came fairli within my reach i fire and shot him directli in the head immedi he sank down into the water but rose instantli and plung up and down as if he were struggl for life and so inde he wa he immedi made to the shore but between the wound which wa hi mortal hurt and the strangl of the water he di just befor he reach the shore it is imposs to express the astonish of these poor creatur at the nois and fire of my gun some of them were even readi to die for fear and fell down as dead with the veri terror but when thei saw the creatur dead and sunk in the water and that i made sign to them to come to the shore thei took heart and came and began to search for the creatur i found him by hi blood stain the water and by the help of a rope which i slung round him and gave the negro to haul thei drag him on shore and found that it wa a most curiou leopard spot and fine to an admir degre and the negro held up their hand with admir to think what it wa i had kill him with the other creatur fright with the flash of fire and the nois of the gun swam on shore and ran up directli to the mountain from whenc thei came nor could i at that distanc know what it wa i found quickli the negro wish to eat the flesh of thi creatur so i wa will to have them take it as a favour from me which when i made sign to them that thei might take him thei were veri thank for immedi thei fell to work with him and though thei had no knife yet with a sharpen piec of wood thei took off hi skin as readili and much more readili than we could have done with a knife thei offer me some of the flesh which i declin point out that i would give it them but made sign for the skin which thei gave me veri freeli and brought me a great deal more of their provis which though i did not understand yet i accept i then made sign to them for some water and held out on of my jar to them turn it bottom upward to show that it wa empti and that i want to have it fill thei call immedi to some of their friend and there came two women and brought a great vessel made of earth and burnt as i suppos in the sun thi thei set down to me as befor and i sent xuri on shore with my jar and fill them all three the women were as nake as the men i wa now furnish with root and corn such as it wa and water and leav my friendli negro i made forward for about eleven dai more without offer to go near the shore till i saw the land run out a great length into the sea at about the distanc of four or five leagu befor me and the sea be veri calm i kept a larg of to make thi point at length doubl the point at about two leagu from the land i saw plainli land on the other side to seaward then i conclud as it wa most certain inde that thi wa the cape de verd and those the island call from thenc cape de verd island howev thei were at a great distanc and i could not well tell what i had best to do for if i should be taken with a fresh of wind i might neither reach on or other in thi dilemma as i wa veri pensiv i step into the cabin and sat down xuri have the helm when on a sudden the boi cri out master master a ship with a sail and the foolish boi wa fright out of hi wit think it must need be some of hi master s ship sent to pursu us but i knew we were far enough out of their reach i jump out of the cabin and immedi saw not onli the ship but that it wa a portugues ship and as i thought wa bound to the coast of guinea for negro but when i observ the cours she steer i wa soon convinc thei were bound some other wai and did not design to come ani nearer to the shore upon which i stretch out to sea as much as i could resolv to speak with them if possibl with all the sail i could make i found i should not be abl to come in their wai but that thei would be gone by befor i could make ani signal to them but after i had crowd to the utmost and began to despair thei it seem saw by the help of their glass that it wa some european boat which thei suppos must belong to some ship that wa lost so thei shorten sail to let me come up i wa encourag with thi and as i had my patron s ancient on board i made a waft of it to them for a signal of distress and fire a gun both which thei saw for thei told me thei saw the smoke though thei did not hear the gun upon these signal thei veri kindli brought to and lai by for me and in about three hour time i came up with them thei ask me what i wa in portugues and in spanish and in french but i understood none of them but at last a scotch sailor who wa on board call to me and i answer him and told him i wa an englishman that i had made my escap out of slaveri from the moor at salle thei then bade me come on board and veri kindli took me in and all my good it wa an inexpress joi to me which ani on will believ that i wa thu deliv as i esteem it from such a miser and almost hopeless condit as i wa in and i immedi offer all i had to the captain of the ship as a return for my deliver but he gener told me he would take noth from me but that all i had should be deliv safe to me when i came to the brazil for sai he i have save your life on no other term than i would be glad to be save myself and it mai on time or other be my lot to be taken up in the same condit besid said he when i carri you to the brazil so great a wai from your own countri if i should take from you what you have you will be starv there and then i onli take awai that life i have given no no sai he seignior ingles mr englishman i will carri you thither in chariti and those thing will help to bui your subsist there and your passag home again as he wa charit in thi propos so he wa just in the perform to a tittl for he order the seamen that none should touch anyth that i had then he took everyth into hi own possess and gave me back an exact inventori of them that i might have them even to my three earthen jar as to my boat it wa a veri good on and that he saw and told me he would bui it of me for hi ship s us and ask me what i would have for it i told him he had been so gener to me in everyth that i could not offer to make ani price of the boat but left it entir to him upon which he told me he would give me a note of hand to pai me eighti piec of eight for it at brazil and when it came there if ani on offer to give more he would make it up he offer me also sixti piec of eight more for my boi xuri which i wa loth to take not that i wa unwil to let the captain have him but i wa veri loth to sell the poor boi s liberti who had assist me so faithfulli in procur my own howev when i let him know my reason he own it to be just and offer me thi medium that he would give the boi an oblig to set him free in ten year if he turn christian upon thi and xuri sai he wa will to go to him i let the captain have him we had a veri good voyag to the brazil and i arriv in the bai de todo lo santo or all saint bai in about twenti two dai after and now i wa onc more deliv from the most miser of all condit of life and what to do next with myself i wa to consid the gener treatment the captain gave me i can never enough rememb he would take noth of me for my passag gave me twenti ducat for the leopard s skin and forti for the lion s skin which i had in my boat and caus everyth i had in the ship to be punctual deliv to me and what i wa will to sell he bought of me such as the case of bottl two of my gun and a piec of the lump of beeswax for i had made candl of the rest in a word i made about two hundr and twenti piec of eight of all my cargo and with thi stock i went on shore in the brazil i had not been long here befor i wa recommend to the hous of a good honest man like himself who had an ingenio as thei call it that is a plantat and a sugar hous i live with him some time and acquaint myself by that mean with the manner of plant and make of sugar and see how well the planter live and how thei got rich suddenli i resolv if i could get a licenc to settl there i would turn planter among them resolv in the meantim to find out some wai to get my monei which i had left in london remit to me to thi purpos get a kind of letter of naturalis i purchas as much land that wa uncur as my monei would reach and form a plan for my plantat and settlement such a on as might be suitabl to the stock which i propos to myself to receiv from england i had a neighbour a portugues of lisbon but born of english parent whose name wa well and in much such circumst as i wa i call him my neighbour becaus hi plantat lai next to mine and we went on veri sociabl togeth my stock wa but low as well as hi and we rather plant for food than anyth els for about two year howev we began to increas and our land began to come into order so that the third year we plant some tobacco and made each of us a larg piec of ground readi for plant cane in the year to come but we both want help and now i found more than befor i had done wrong in part with my boi xuri but ala for me to do wrong that never did right wa no great wonder i hail no remedi but to go on i had got into an employ quit remot to my geniu and directli contrari to the life i delight in and for which i forsook my father s hous and broke through all hi good advic nai i wa come into the veri middl station or upper degre of low life which my father advis me to befor and which if i resolv to go on with i might as well have stai at home and never have fatigu myself in the world as i had done and i us often to sai to myself i could have done thi as well in england among my friend as have gone five thousand mile off to do it among stranger and savag in a wilder and at such a distanc as never to hear from ani part of the world that had the least knowledg of me in thi manner i us to look upon my condit with the utmost regret i had nobodi to convers with but now and then thi neighbour no work to be done but by the labour of my hand and i us to sai i live just like a man cast awai upon some

unjustli compar it with the life which i then led in which had i continu i had in all probabl been exceed prosper and rich i wa in some degre settl in my measur for carri on the plantat befor my kind

miscarriag were procur by my appar obstin adher to my foolish inclin of wander abroad and pursu that inclin in contradict to the clearest view of do myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospect and those measur of life which natur and provid concur to present me with and to make my duti as i had onc done thu in my break awai from my parent so i could not be content now but i must go and leav the happi view i had of be a rich and thrive man in my new plantat onli to pursu a rash and immoder desir of rise faster than the natur of the thing admit and thu i cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of human miseri that ever man fell into or perhap could be consist with life and a state of health in the world to come then by the just degre to the particular of thi part of my stori you mai suppos that have now live almost four year in the brazil and begin to thrive and prosper veri well upon my plantat i had not onli learn the languag but had contract acquaint and friendship among my fellow planter as well as among the merchant at st salvador which wa our port and that in my discours among them i had frequent given them an account of my two voyag to the coast of guinea the manner of trade with the negro there and how easi it wa to purchas upon the coast for trifl such as bead toi knive scissor hatchet bit of glass and the like not onli gold dust guinea grain eleph teeth c but negro for the servic of the brazil in great number thei listen alwai veri attent to my discours on these head but especi to that part which relat to the bui of negro which wa a trade at that time not onli not far enter into but as far as it wa had been carri on by assiento or permiss of the king of spain and portug and engross in the public stock so that few negro were bought and these excess dear it happen be in compani with some merchant and planter of my acquaint and talk of those thing veri earnestli three of them came to me next morn and told me thei had been muse veri much upon what i had discours with them of the last night and thei came to make a secret propos to me and after enjoin me to secreci thei told me that thei had a mind to fit out a ship to go to guinea that thei had all plantat as well as i and were straiten for noth so much as servant that as it wa a trade that could not be carri on becaus thei could not publicli sell the negro when thei came home so thei desir to make but on voyag to bring the negro on shore privat and divid them among their own plantat and in a word the question wa whether i would go their supercargo in the ship to manag the trade part upon the coast of guinea and thei offer me that i should have my equal share of the negro without provid ani part of the stock thi wa a fair propos it must be confess had it been made to ani on that had not had a settlement and a plantat of hi own to look after which wa in a fair wai of come to be veri consider and with a good stock upon it but for me that wa thu enter and establish and had noth to do but to go on as i had begun for three or four year more and to have sent for the other hundr pound from england and who in that time and with that littl addit could scarc have fail of be worth three or four thousand pound sterl and that increas too for me to think of such a voyag wa the most preposter thing that ever man in such circumst could be guilti of but i that wa born to be my own destroy could no more resist the offer than i could restrain my first rambl design when my father s good counsel wa lost upon me in a word i told them i would go with all my heart if thei would undertak to look after my plantat in my absenc and would dispos of it to such as i should direct if i miscarri thi thei all engag to do and enter into write or coven to do so and i made a formal will dispos of my plantat and effect in case of my death make the captain of the ship that had save my life as befor my univers heir but oblig him to dispos of my effect as i had direct in my will on half of the produc be to himself and the other to be ship to england in short i took all possibl caution to preserv my effect and to keep up my plantat had i us half as much prudenc to have look into my own interest and have made a judgment of what i ought to have done and not to have done i had certainli never gone awai from so prosper an undertak leav all the probabl view of a thrive circumst and gone upon a voyag to sea attend with all it common hazard to sai noth of the reason i had to expect particular misfortun to myself but i wa hurri on and obei blindli the dictat of my fanci rather than my reason and accordingli the ship be fit out and the cargo furnish and all thing done as by agreement by my partner in the voyag i went on board in an evil hour the st septemb be the same dai eight year that i went from my father and mother at hull in order to act the rebel to their author and the fool to my own interest our ship wa about on hundr and twenti ton burden carri six gun and fourteen men besid the master hi boi and myself we had on board no larg cargo of good except of such toi as were fit for our trade with the negro such as bead bit of glass shell and other trifl especi littl look glass knive scissor hatchet and the like the same dai i went on board we set sail stand awai to the northward upon our own coast with design to stretch over for the african coast when we came about ten or twelv degre of northern latitud which it seem wa the manner of cours in those dai we had veri good weather onli excess hot all the wai upon our own coast till we came to the height of cape st augustino from whenc keep further off at sea we lost sight of land and steer as if we were bound for the isl fernando de noronha hold our cours n e by n and leav those isl on the east in thi cours we pass the line in about twelv dai time and were by our last observ in seven degre twenti two minut northern latitud when a violent tornado or hurrican took us quit out of our knowledg it began from the south east came about to the north west and then settl in the north east from whenc it blew in such a terribl manner that for twelv dai togeth we could do noth but drive and scud awai befor it let it carri us whither fate and the furi of the wind direct and dure these twelv dai i need not sai that i expect everi dai to be swallow up nor inde did ani in the ship expect to save their live in thi distress we had besid the terror of the storm on of our men die of the calentur and on man and the boi wash overboard about the twelfth dai the weather abat a littl the master made an observ as well as he could and found that he wa in about eleven degre north latitud but that he wa twenti two degre of longitud differ west from cape st augustino so that he found he wa upon the coast of guiana or the north part of brazil beyond the river amazon toward that of the river orinoco commonli call the great river and began to consult with me what cours he should take for the ship wa leaki and veri much disabl and he wa go directli back to the coast of brazil i wa posit against that and look over the chart of the sea coast of america with him we conclud there wa no inhabit countri for us to have recours to till we came within the circl of the caribbe island and therefor resolv to stand awai for barbado which by keep off at sea to avoid the indraft of the bai or gulf of mexico we might easili perform as we hope in about fifteen dai sail wherea we could not possibl make our voyag to the coast of africa without some assist both to our ship and to ourselv with thi design we chang our cours and steer awai n w by w in order to reach some of our english island where i hope for relief but our voyag wa otherwis determin for be in the latitud of twelv degre eighteen minut a second storm came upon us which carri us awai with the same impetuos westward and drove us so out of the wai of all human commerc that had all our live been save as to the sea we were rather in danger of be devour by savag than ever return to our own countri in thi distress the wind still blow veri hard on of our men earli in the morn cri out land and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out in hope of see whereabout in the world we were than the ship struck upon a sand and in a moment her motion be so stop the sea broke over her in such a manner that we expect we should all have perish immedi and we were immedi driven into our close quarter to shelter us from the veri foam and sprai of the sea it is not easi for ani on who ha not been in the like condit to describ or conceiv the constern of men in such circumst we knew noth where we were or upon what land it wa we were driven whether an island or the main whether inhabit or not inhabit as the rage of the wind wa still great though rather less than at first we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold mani minut without break into piec unless the wind by a kind of miracl should turn immedi about in a word we sat look upon on anoth and expect death everi moment and everi man accordingli prepar for anoth world for there wa littl or noth more for us to do in thi that which wa our present comfort and all the comfort we had wa that contrari to our expect the ship did not break yet and that the master said the wind began to abat now though we thought that the wind did a littl abat yet the ship have thu struck upon the sand and stick too fast for us to expect her get off we were in a dread condit inde and had noth to do but to think of save our live as well as we could we had a boat at our stern just befor the storm but she wa first stave by dash against the ship s rudder and in the next place she broke awai and either sunk or wa driven off to sea so there wa no hope from her we had anoth boat on board but how to get her off into the sea wa a doubt thing howev there wa no time to debat for we fanci that the ship would break in piec everi minut and some told us she wa actual broken alreadi in thi distress the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat and with the help of the rest of the men got her slung over the ship s side and get all into her let go and commit ourselv be eleven in number to god s merci and the wild sea for though the storm wa abat consider yet the sea ran dreadfulli high upon the shore and might be well call den wild zee as the dutch call the sea in a storm and now our case wa veri dismal inde for we all saw plainli that the sea went so high that the boat could not live and that we should be inevit drown as to make sail we had none nor if we had could we have done anyth with it so we work at the oar toward the land though with heavi heart like men go to execut for we all knew that when the boat came near the shore she would be dash in a thousand piec by the breach of the sea howev we commit our soul to god in the most earnest manner and the wind drive us toward the shore we hasten our destruct with our own hand pull as well as we could toward land what the shore wa whether rock or sand whether steep or shoal we knew not the onli hope that could ration give us the least shadow of expect wa if we might find some bai or gulf or the mouth of some river where by great chanc we might have run our boat in or got under the lee of the land and perhap made smooth water but there wa noth like thi appear but as we made nearer and nearer the shore the land look more fright than the sea after we had row or rather driven about a leagu and a half as we reckon it a rage wave mountain like came roll astern of us and plainli bade us expect the coup de grace it took us with such a furi that it overset the boat at onc and separ us as well from the boat as from on anoth gave us no time to sai o god for we were all swallow up in a moment noth can describ the confus of thought which i felt when i sank into the water for though i swam veri well yet i could not deliv myself from the wave so as to draw breath till that wave have driven me or rather carri me a vast wai on toward the shore and have spent itself went back and left me upon the land almost dry but half dead with the water i took in i had so much presenc of mind as well as breath left that see myself nearer the mainland than i expect i got upon my feet and endeavour to make on toward the land as fast as i could befor anoth wave should return and take me up again but i soon found it wa imposs to avoid it for i saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill and as furiou as an enemi which i had no mean or strength to contend with my busi wa to hold my breath and rais myself upon the water if i could and so by swim to preserv my breath and pilot myself toward the shore if possibl my greatest concern now be that the sea as it would carri me a great wai toward the shore when it came on might not carri me back again with it when it gave back toward the sea the wave that came upon me again buri me at onc twenti or thirti feet deep in it own bodi and i could feel myself carri with a mighti forc and swift toward the shore a veri great wai but i held my breath and assist myself to swim still forward with all my might i wa readi to burst with hold my breath when as i felt myself rise up so to my immedi relief i found my head and hand shoot out abov the surfac of the water and though it wa not two second of time that i could keep myself so yet it reliev me greatli gave me breath and new courag i wa cover again with water a good while but not so long but i held it out and find the water had spent itself and began to return i struck forward against the return of the wave and felt ground again with my feet i stood still a few moment to recov breath and till the water went from me and then took to my heel and ran with what strength i had further toward the shore but neither would thi deliv me from the furi of the sea which came pour in after me again and twice more i wa lift up by the wave and carri forward as befor the shore be veri flat the last time of these two had well nigh been fatal to me for the sea have hurri me along as befor land me or rather dash me against a piec of rock and that with such forc that it left me senseless and inde helpless as to my own deliver for the blow take my side and breast beat the breath as it were quit out of my bodi and had it return again immedi i must have been strangl in the water but i recov a littl befor the return of the wave and see i should be cover again with the water i resolv to hold fast by a piec of the rock and so to hold my breath if possibl till the wave went back now as the wave were not so high as at first be nearer land i held my hold till the wave abat and then fetch anoth run which brought me so near the shore that the next wave though it went over me yet did not so swallow me up as to carri me awai and the next run i took i got to the mainland where to my great comfort i clamber up the cliff of the shore and sat me down upon the grass free from danger and quit out of the reach of the water i wa now land and safe on shore and began to look up and thank god that my life wa save in a case wherein there wa some minut befor scarc ani room to hope i believ it is imposs to express to the life what the ecstasi and transport of the soul ar when it is so save as i mai sai out of the veri grave and i do not wonder now at the custom when a malefactor who ha the halter about hi neck is ti up and just go to be turn off and ha a repriev brought to him i sai i do not wonder that thei bring a surgeon with it to let him blood that veri moment thei tell him of it that the surpris mai not drive the anim spirit from the heart and overwhelm him for sudden joi like grief confound at first i walk about on the shore lift up my hand and my whole be as i mai sai wrap up in a contempl of my deliver make a thousand gestur and motion which i cannot describ reflect upon all my comrad that were drown and that there should not be on soul save but myself for as for them i never saw them afterward or ani sign of them except three of their hat on cap and two shoe that were not fellow i cast my ey to the strand vessel when the breach and froth of the sea be so big i could hardli see it it lai so far of and consid lord how wa it possibl i could get on shore after i had solac my mind with the comfort part of my condit i began to look round me to see what kind of place i wa in and what wa next to be done and i soon found my comfort abat and that in a word i had a dread deliver for i wa wet had no cloth to shift me nor anyth either to eat or drink to comfort me neither did i see ani prospect befor me but that of perish with hunger or be devour by wild beast and that which wa particularli afflict to me wa that i had no weapon either to hunt and kill ani creatur for my susten or to defend myself against ani other creatur that might desir to kill me for their in a word i had noth about me but a knife a tobacco pipe and a littl tobacco in a box thi wa all my provis and thi threw me into such terribl agoni of mind that for a while i ran about like a madman night come upon me i began with a heavi heart to consid what would be my lot if there were ani raven beast in that countri as at night thei alwai come abroad for their prei all the remedi that offer to my thought at that time wa to get up into a thick bushi tree like a fir but thorni which grew near me and where i resolv to sit all night and consid the next dai what death i should die for as yet i saw no prospect of life i walk about a furlong from the shore to see if i could find ani fresh water to drink which i did to my great joi and have drank and put a littl tobacco into my mouth to prevent hunger i went to the tree and get up into it endeavour to place myself so that if i should sleep i might not fall and have cut me a short stick like a truncheon for my defenc i took up my lodg and have been excess fatigu i fell fast asleep and slept as comfort as i believ few could have done in my condit and found myself more refresh with it than i think i ever wa on such an occas chapter iv first week on the island when i wake it wa broad dai the weather clear and the storm abat so that the sea did not rage and swell as befor but that which surpris me most wa that the ship wa lift off in the night from the sand where she lai by the swell of the tide and wa driven up almost as far as the rock which i at first mention where i had been so bruis by the wave dash me against it thi be within about a mile from the shore where i wa and the ship seem to stand upright still i wish myself on board that at least i might save some necessari thing for my us when i came down from my apart in the tree i look about me again and the first thing i found wa the boat which lai as the wind and the sea had toss her up upon the land about two mile on my right hand i walk as far as i could upon the shore to have got to her but found a neck or inlet of water between me and the boat which wa about half a mile broad so i came back for the present be more intent upon get at the ship where i hope to find someth for my present subsist a littl after noon i found the sea veri calm and the tide eb so far out that i could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship and here i found a fresh renew of my grief for i saw evid that if we had kept on board we had been all safe that is to sai we had all got safe on shore and i had not been so miser as to be left entir destitut of all comfort and compani as i now wa thi forc tear to my ey again but as there wa littl relief in that i resolv if possibl to get to the ship so i pull off my cloth for the weather wa hot to extrem and took the water but when i came to the ship my difficulti wa still greater to know how to get on board for as she lai aground and high out of the water there wa noth within my reach to lai hold of i swam round her twice and the second time i spi a small piec of rope which i wonder i did not see at first hung down by the fore chain so low as that with great difficulti i got hold of it and by the help of that rope i got up into the forecastl of the ship here i found that the ship wa bulg and had a great deal of water in her hold but that she lai so on the side of a bank of hard sand or rather earth that her stern lai lift up upon the bank and her head low almost to the water by thi mean all her quarter wa free and all that wa in that part wa dry for you mai be sure my first work wa to search and to see what wa spoil and what wa free and first i found that all the ship s provis were dry and untouch by the water and be veri well dispos to eat i went to the bread room and fill my pocket with biscuit and at it as i went about other thing for i had no time to lose i also found some rum in the great cabin of which i took a larg dram and which i had inde need enough of to spirit me for what wa befor me now i want noth but a boat to furnish myself with mani thing which i foresaw would be veri necessari to me it wa in vain to sit still and wish for what wa not to be had and thi extrem rous my applic we had sever spare yard and two or three larg spar of wood and a spare topmast or two in the ship i resolv to fall to work with these and i flung as mani of them overboard as i could manag for their weight ty everi on with a rope that thei might not drive awai when thi wa done i went down the ship s side and pull them to me i ti four of them togeth at both end as well as i could in the form of a raft and lai two or three short piec of plank upon them crosswai i found i could walk upon it veri well but that it wa not abl to bear ani great weight the piec be too light so i went to work and with a carpent s saw i cut a spare topmast into three length and ad them to my raft with a great deal of labour and pain but the hope of furnish myself with necessari encourag me to go beyond what i should have been abl to have done upon anoth occas my raft wa now strong enough to bear ani reason weight my next care wa what to load it with and how to preserv what i laid upon it from the surf of the sea but i wa not long consid thi i first laid all the plank or board upon it that i could get and have consid well what i most want i got three of the seamen s chest which i had broken open and empti and lower them down upon my raft the first of these i fill with provis viz bread rice three dutch chees five piec of dri goat s flesh which we live much upon and a littl remaind of european corn which had been laid by for some fowl which we brought to sea with us but the fowl were kill there had been some barlei and wheat togeth but to my great disappoint i found afterward that the rat had eaten or spoil it all as for liquor i found sever case of bottl belong to our skipper in which were some cordial water and in all about five or six gallon of rack these i stow by themselv there be no need to put them into the chest nor ani room for them while i wa do thi i found the tide begin to flow though veri calm and i had the mortif to see my coat shirt and waistcoat which i had left on the shore upon the sand swim awai as for my breech which were onli linen and open kneed i swam on board in them and my stock howev thi set me on rummag for cloth of which i found enough but took no more than i want for present us for i had other thing which my ey wa more upon as first tool to work with on shore and it wa after long search that i found out the carpent s chest which wa inde a veri us prize to me and much more valuabl than a shipload of gold would have been at that time i got it down to my raft whole as it wa without lose time to look into it for i knew in gener what it contain my next care wa for some ammunit and arm there were two veri good fowl piec in the great cabin and two pistol these i secur first with some powder horn and a small bag of shot and two old rusti sword i knew there were three barrel of powder in the ship but knew not where our gunner had stow them but with much search i found them two of them dry and good the third had taken water those two i got to my raft with the arm and now i thought myself pretti well freight and began to think how i should get to shore with them have neither sail oar nor rudder and the least cap of wind would have overset all my navig i had three encourag st a smooth calm sea ndly the tide rise and set in to the shore rdly what littl wind there wa blew me toward the land and thu have found two or three broken oar belong to the boat and besid the tool which were in the chest i found two saw an ax and a hammer with thi cargo i put to sea for a mile or thereabout my raft went veri well onli that i found it drive a littl distant from the place where i had land befor by which i perceiv that there wa some indraft of the water and consequ i hope to find some creek or river there which i might make us of as a port to get to land with my cargo as i imagin so it wa there appear befor me a littl open of the land and i found a strong current of the tide set into it so i guid my raft as well as i could to keep in the middl of the stream but here i had like to have suffer a second shipwreck which if i had i think verili would have broken my heart for know noth of the coast my raft ran aground at on end of it upon a shoal and not be aground at the other end it want but a littl that all my cargo had slip off toward the end that wa afloat and to fallen into the water i did my utmost by set my back against the chest to keep them in their place but could not thrust off the raft with all my strength neither durst i stir from the postur i wa in but hold up the chest with all my might i stood in that manner near half an hour in which time the rise of the water brought me a littl more upon a level and a littl after the water still rise my raft float again and i thrust her off with the oar i had into the channel and then drive up higher i at length found myself in the mouth of a littl river with land on both side and a strong current of tide run up i look on both side for a proper place to get to shore for i wa not will to be driven too high up the river hope in time to see some ship at sea and therefor resolv to place myself as near the coast as i could at length i spi a littl cove on the right shore of the creek to which with great pain and difficulti i guid my raft and at last got so near that reach ground with my oar i could thrust her directli in but here i had like to have dip all my cargo into the sea again for that shore ly pretti steep that is to sai slope there wa no place to land but where on end of my float if it ran on shore would lie so high and the other sink lower as befor that it would endang my cargo again all that i could do wa to wait till the tide wa at the highest keep the raft with my oar like an anchor to hold the side of it fast to the shore near a flat piec of ground which i expect the water would flow over and so it did as soon as i found water enough for my raft drew about a foot of water i thrust her upon that flat piec of ground and there fasten or moor her by stick my two broken oar into the ground on on on side near on end and on on the other side near the other end and thu i lai till the water eb awai and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore my next work wa to view the countri and seek a proper place for my habit and where to stow my good to secur them from whatev might happen where i wa i yet knew not whether on the contin or on an island whether inhabit or not inhabit whether in danger of wild beast or not there wa a hill not abov a mile from me which rose up veri steep and high and which seem to overtop some other hill which lai as in a ridg from it northward i took out on of the fowl piec and on of the pistol and a horn of powder and thu arm i travel for discoveri up to the top of that hill where after i had with great labour and difficulti got to the top i saw my fate to my great afflict viz that i wa in an island environ everi wai with the sea no land to be seen except some rock which lai a great wai off and two small island less than thi which lai about three leagu to the west i found also that the island i wa in wa barren and as i saw good reason to believ uninhabit except by wild beast of whom howev i saw none yet i saw abund of fowl but knew not their kind neither when i kill them could i tell what wa fit for food and what not at my come back i shot at a great bird which i saw sit upon a tree on the side of a great wood i believ it wa the first gun that had been fire there sinc the creation of the world i had no sooner fire than from all part of the wood there aros an innumer number of fowl of mani sort make a confus scream and cry and everi on accord to hi usual note but not on of them of ani kind that i knew as for the creatur i kill i took it to be a kind of hawk it colour and beak resembl it but it had no talon or claw more than common it flesh wa carrion and fit for noth content with thi discoveri i came back to my raft and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore which took me up the rest of that dai what to do with myself at night i knew not nor inde where to rest for i wa afraid to lie down on the ground not know but some wild beast might devour me though as i afterward found there wa realli no need for those fear howev as well as i could i barricad myself round with the chest and board that i had brought on shore and made a kind of hut for that night s lodg as for food i yet saw not which wai to suppli myself except that i had seen two or three creatur like hare run out of the wood where i shot the fowl i now began to consid that i might yet get a great mani thing out of the ship which would be us to me and particularli some of the rig and sail and such other thing as might come to land and i resolv to make anoth voyag on board the vessel if possibl and as i knew that the first storm that blew must necessarili break her all in piec i resolv to set all other thing apart till i had got everyth out of the ship that i could get then i call a council that is to sai in my thought whether i should take back the raft but thi appear impractic so i resolv to go as befor when the tide wa down and i did so onli that i strip befor i went from my hut have noth on but my chequer shirt a pair of linen drawer and a pair of pump on my feet i got on board the ship as befor and prepar a second raft and have had experi of the first i neither made thi so unwieldi nor load it so hard but yet i brought awai sever thing veri us to me as first in the carpent store i found two or three bag full of nail and spike a great screw jack a dozen or two of hatchet and abov all that most us thing call a grindston all these i secur togeth with sever thing belong to the gunner particularli two or three iron crow and two barrel of musket bullet seven musket anoth fowl piec with some small quantiti of powder more a larg bag of small shot and a great roll of sheet lead but thi last wa so heavi i could not hoist it up to get it over the ship s side besid these thing i took all the men s cloth that i could find and a spare fore topsail a hammock and some bed and with thi i load my second raft and brought them all safe on shore to my veri great comfort i wa under some apprehens dure my absenc from the land that at least my provis might be devour on shore but when i came back i found no sign of ani visitor onli there sat a creatur like a wild cat upon on of the chest which when i came toward it ran awai a littl distanc and then stood still she sat veri compos and unconcern and look full in my face as if she had a mind to be acquaint with me i present my gun at her but as she did not understand it she wa perfectli unconcern at it nor did she offer to stir awai upon which i toss her a bit of biscuit though by the wai i wa not veri free of it for my store wa not great howev i spare her a bit i sai and she went to it smell at it and at it and look as if pleas for more but i thank her and could spare no more so she march off have got my second cargo on shore though i wa fain to open the barrel of powder and bring them by parcel for thei were too heavi be larg cask i went to work to make me a littl tent with the sail and some pole which i cut for that purpos and into thi tent i brought everyth that i knew would spoil either with rain or sun and i pile all the empti chest and cask up in a circl round the tent to fortifi it from ani sudden attempt either from man or beast when i had done thi i block up the door of the tent with some board within and an empti chest set up on end without and spread on of the bed upon the ground lai my two pistol just at my head and my gun at length by me i went to bed for the first time and slept veri quietli all night for i wa veri weari and heavi for the night befor i had slept littl and had labour veri hard all dai to fetch all those thing from the ship and to get them on shore i had the biggest magazin of all kind now that ever wa laid up i believ for on man but i wa not satisfi still for while the ship sat upright in that postur i thought i ought to get everyth out of her that i could so everi dai at low water i went on board and brought awai someth or other but particularli the third time i went i brought awai as much of the rig as i could as also all the small rope and rope twine i could get with a piec of spare canva which wa to mend the sail upon occas and the barrel of wet gunpowd in a word i brought awai all the sail first and last onli that i wa fain to cut them in piec and bring as much at a time as i could for thei were no more us to be sail but as mere canva onli but that which comfort me more still wa that last of all after i had made five or six such voyag as these and thought i had noth more to expect from the ship that wa worth my meddl with i sai after all thi i found a great hogshead of bread three larg runlet of rum or spirit a box of sugar and a barrel of fine flour thi wa surpris to me becaus i had given over expect ani more provis except what wa spoil by the water i soon empti the hogshead of the bread and wrap it up parcel by parcel in piec of the sail which i cut out and in a word i got all thi safe on shore also the next dai i made anoth voyag and now have plunder the ship of what wa portabl and fit to hand out i began with the cabl cut the great cabl into piec such as i could move i got two cabl and a hawser on shore with all the ironwork i could get and have cut down the spritsail yard and the mizzen yard and everyth i could to make a larg raft i load it with all these heavi good and came awai but my good luck began now to leav me for thi raft wa so unwieldi and so overladen that after i had enter the littl cove where i had land the rest of my good not be abl to guid it so handili as i did the other it overset and threw me and all my cargo into the water as for myself it wa no great harm for i wa near the shore but as to my cargo it wa a great part of it lost especi the iron which i expect would have been of great us to me howev when the tide wa out i got most of the piec of the cabl ashor and some of the iron though with infinit labour for i wa fain to dip for it into the water a work which fatigu me veri much after thi i went everi dai on board and brought awai what i could get i had been now thirteen dai on shore and had been eleven time on board the ship in which time i had brought awai all that on pair of hand could well be suppos capabl to bring though i believ verili had the calm weather held i should have brought awai the whole ship piec by piec but prepar the twelfth time to go on board i found the wind began to rise howev at low water i went on board and though i thought i had rummag the cabin so effectu that noth more could be found yet i discov a locker with drawer in it in on of which i found two or three razor and on pair of larg scissor with some ten or a dozen of good knive and fork in anoth i found about thirti six pound valu in monei some european coin some brazil some piec of eight some gold and some silver i smile to myself at the sight of thi monei o drug said i aloud what art thou good for thou art not worth to me no not the take off the ground on of those knive is worth all thi heap i have no manner of us for thee e en remain where thou art and go to the bottom as a creatur whose life is not worth sai howev upon second thought i took it awai and wrap all thi in a piec of canva i began to think of make anoth raft but while i wa prepar thi i found the sky overcast and the wind began to rise and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore it present occur to me that it wa in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind offshor and that it wa my busi to be gone befor the tide of flood began otherwis i might not be abl to reach the shore at all accordingli i let myself down into the water and swam across the channel which lai between the ship and the sand and even that with difficulti enough partli with the weight of the thing i had about me and partli the rough of the water for the wind rose veri hastili and befor it wa quit high water it blew a storm but i had got home to my littl tent where i lai with all my wealth about me veri secur it blew veri hard all night and in the morn when i look out behold no more ship wa to be seen i wa a littl surpris but recov myself with the satisfactori reflect that i had lost no time nor abat ani dilig to get everyth out of her that could be us to me and that inde there wa littl left in her that i wa abl to bring awai if i had had more time i now gave over ani more thought of the ship or of anyth out of her except what might drive on shore from her wreck as inde diver piec of her afterward did but those thing were of small us to me my thought were now wholli emploi about secur myself against either savag if ani should appear or wild beast if ani were in the island and i had mani thought of the method how to do thi and what kind of dwell to make whether i should make me a cave in the earth or a tent upon the earth and in short i resolv upon both the manner and descript of which it mai not be improp to give an account of i soon found the place i wa in wa not fit for my settlement becaus it wa upon a low moorish ground near the sea and i believ it would not be wholesom and more particularli becaus there wa no fresh water near it so i resolv to find a more healthi and more conveni spot of ground i consult sever thing in my situat which i found would be proper for me st health and fresh water i just now mention ndly shelter from the heat of the sun rdly secur from raven creatur whether man or beast thly a view to the sea that if god sent ani ship in sight i might not lose ani advantag for my deliver of which i wa not will to banish all my expect yet in search of a place proper for thi i found a littl plain on the side of a rise hill whose front toward thi littl plain wa steep as a hous side so that noth could come down upon me from the top on the on side of the rock there wa a hollow place worn a littl wai in like the entranc or door of a cave but there wa not realli ani cave or wai into the rock at all on the flat of the green just befor thi hollow place i resolv to pitch my tent thi plain wa not abov a hundr yard broad and about twice as long and lai like a green befor my door and at the end of it descend irregularli everi wai down into the low ground by the seasid it wa on the n n w side of the hill so that it wa shelter from the heat everi dai till it came to a w and by s sun or thereabout which in those countri is near the set befor i set up my tent i drew a half circl befor the hollow place which took in about ten yard in it semi diamet from the rock and twenti yard in it diamet from it begin and end in thi half circl i pitch two row of strong stake drive them into the ground till thei stood veri firm like pile the biggest end be out of the ground abov five feet and a half and sharpen on the top the two row did not stand abov six inch from on anoth then i took the piec of cabl which i had cut in the ship and laid them in row on upon anoth within the circl between these two row of stake up to the top place other stake in the insid lean against them about two feet and a half high like a spur to a post and thi fenc wa so strong that neither man nor beast could get into it or over it thi cost me a great deal of time and labour especi to cut the pile in the wood bring them to the place and drive them into the earth the entranc into thi place i made to be not by a door but by a short ladder to go over the top which ladder when i wa in i lift over after me and so i wa complet fenc in and fortifi as i thought from all the world and consequ slept secur in the night which otherwis i could not have done though as it appear afterward there wa no need of all thi caution from the enemi that i apprehend danger from into thi fenc or fortress with infinit labour i carri all my rich all my provis ammunit and store of which you have the account abov and i made a larg tent which to preserv me from the rain that in on part of the year ar veri violent there i made doubl on smaller tent within and on larger tent abov it and cover the uppermost with a larg tarpaulin which i had save among the sail and now i lai no more for a while in the bed which i had brought on shore but in a hammock which wa inde a veri good on and belong to the mate of the ship into thi tent i brought all my provis and everyth that would spoil by the wet and have thu enclos all my good i made up the entranc which till now i had left open and so pass and repass as i said by a short ladder when i had done thi i began to work my wai into the rock and bring all the earth and stone that i dug down out through my tent i laid them up within my fenc in the natur of a terrac so that it rais the ground within about a foot and a half and thu i made me a cave just behind my tent which serv me like a cellar to my hous it cost me much labour and mani dai befor all these thing were brought to perfect and therefor i must go back to some other thing which took up some of my thought at the same time it happen after i had laid my scheme for the set up my tent and make the cave that a storm of rain fall from a thick dark cloud a sudden flash of lightn happen and after that a great clap of thunder as is natur the effect of it i wa not so much surpris with the lightn as i wa with the thought which dart into my mind as swift as the lightn itself oh my powder my veri heart sank within me when i thought that at on blast all my powder might be destroi on which not my defenc onli but the provid my food as i thought entir depend i wa noth near so anxiou about my own danger though had the powder took fire i should never have known who had hurt me such impress did thi make upon me that after the storm wa over i laid asid all my work my build and fortifi and appli myself to make bag and box to separ the powder and to keep it a littl and a littl in a parcel in the hope that whatev might come it might not all take fire at onc and to keep it so apart that it should not be possibl to make on part fire anoth i finish thi work in about a fortnight and i think my powder which in all wa about two hundr and forti pound weight wa divid in not less than a hundr parcel as to the barrel that had been wet i did not apprehend ani danger from that so i place it in my new cave which in my fanci i call my kitchen and the rest i hid up and down in hole among the rock so that no wet might come to it mark veri carefulli where i laid it in the interv of time while thi wa do i went out onc at least everi dai with my gun as well to divert myself as to see if i could kill anyth fit for food and as near as i could to acquaint myself with what the island produc the first time i went out i present discov that there were goat in the island which wa a great satisfact to me but then it wa attend with thi misfortun to me viz that thei were so shy so subtl and so swift of foot that it wa the most difficult thing in the world to come at them but i wa not discourag at thi not doubt but i might now and then shoot on as it soon happen for after i had found their haunt a littl i laid wait in thi manner for them i observ if thei saw me in the vallei though thei were upon the rock thei would run awai as in a terribl fright but if thei were feed in the vallei and i wa upon the rock thei took no notic of me from whenc i conclud that by the posit of their optic their sight wa so direct downward that thei did not readili see object that were abov them so afterward i took thi method i alwai climb the rock first to get abov them and then had frequent a fair mark the first shot i made among these creatur i kill a she goat which had a littl kid by her which she gave suck to which griev me heartili for when the old on fell the kid stood stock still by her till i came and took her up and not onli so but when i carri the old on with me upon my shoulder the kid follow me quit to my enclosur upon which i laid down the dam and took the kid in my arm and carri it over my pale in hope to have bred it up tame but it would not eat so i wa forc to kill it and eat it myself these two suppli me with flesh a great while for i at sparingli and save my provis my bread especi as much as possibl i could have now fix my habit i found it absolut necessari to provid a place to make a fire in and fuel to burn and what i did for that and also how i enlarg my cave and what conveni i made i shall give a full account of in it place but i must now give some littl account of myself and of my thought about live which it mai well be suppos were not a few i had a dismal prospect of my condit for as i wa not cast awai upon that island without be driven as is said by a violent storm quit out of the cours of our intend voyag and a great wai viz some hundr of leagu out of the ordinari cours of the trade of mankind i had great reason to consid it as a determin of heaven that in thi desol place and in thi desol manner i should end my life the tear would run plentifulli down my face when i made these reflect and sometim i would expostul with myself why provid should thu complet ruin hi creatur and render them so absolut miser so without help abandon so entir depress that it could hardli be ration to be thank for such a life but someth alwai return swift upon me to check these thought and to reprov me and particularli on dai walk with my gun in my hand by the seasid i wa veri pensiv upon the subject of my present condit when reason as it were expostul with me the other wai thu well you ar in a desol condit it is true but prai rememb where ar the rest of you did not you come eleven of you in the boat where ar the ten why were thei not save and you lost why were you singl out is it better to be here or there and then i point to the sea all evil ar to be consid with the good that is in them and with what wors attend them then it occur to me again how well i wa furnish for my subsist and what would have been my case if it had not happen which wa a hundr thousand to on that the ship float from the place where she first struck and wa driven so near to the shore that i had time to get all these thing out of her what would have been my case if i had been forc to have live in the condit in which i at first came on shore without necessari of life or necessari to suppli and procur them particularli said i aloud though to myself what should i have done without a gun without ammunit without ani tool to make anyth or to work with without cloth bed a tent or ani manner of cover and that now i had all these to suffici quantiti and wa in a fair wai to provid myself in such a manner as to live without my gun when my ammunit wa spent so that i had a toler view of subsist without ani want as long as i live for i consid from the begin how i would provid for the accid that might happen and for the time that wa to come even not onli after my ammunit should be spent but even after my health and strength should decai i confess i had not entertain ani notion of my ammunit be destroi at on blast i mean my powder be blown up by lightn and thi made the thought of it so surpris to me when it lighten and thunder as i observ just now and now be about to enter into a melancholi relat of a scene of silent life such perhap as wa never heard of in the world befor i shall take it from it begin and continu it in it order it wa by my account the th of septemb when in the manner as abov said i first set foot upon thi horrid island when the sun be to us in it autumn equinox wa almost over my head for i reckon myself by observ to be in the latitud of nine degre twenti two minut north of the line after i had been there about ten or twelv dai it came into my thought that i should lose my reckon of time for want of book and pen and ink and should even forget the sabbath dai but to prevent thi i cut with my knife upon a larg post in capit letter and make it into a great cross i set it up on the shore where i first land i came on shore here on the th septemb upon the side of thi squar post i cut everi dai a notch with my knife and everi seventh notch wa as long again as the rest and everi first dai of the month as long again as that long on and thu i kept my calendar or weekli monthli and yearli reckon of time in the next place we ar to observ that among the mani thing which i brought out of the ship in the sever voyag which as abov mention i made to it i got sever thing of less valu but not at all less us to me which i omit set down befor as in particular pen ink and paper sever parcel in the captain s mate s gunner s and carpent s keep three or four compass some mathemat instrument dial perspect chart and book of navig all which i huddl togeth whether i might want them or no also i found three veri good bibl which came to me in my cargo from england and which i had pack up among my thing some portugues book also and among them two or three popish prayer book and sever other book all which i carefulli secur and i must not forget that we had in the ship a dog and two cat of whose emin histori i mai have occas to sai someth in it place for i carri both the cat with me and as for the dog he jump out of the ship of himself and swam on shore to me the dai after i went on shore with my first cargo and wa a trusti servant to me mani year i want noth that he could fetch me nor ani compani that he could make up to me i onli want to have him talk to me but that would not do as i observ befor i found pen ink and paper and i husband them to the utmost and i shall show that while my ink last i kept thing veri exact but after that wa gone i could not for i could not make ani ink by ani mean that i could devis and thi put me in mind that i want mani thing notwithstand all that i had amass togeth and of these ink wa on as also a spade pickax and shovel to dig or remov the earth needl pin and thread as for linen i soon learn to want that without much difficulti thi want of tool made everi work i did go on heavili and it wa near a whole year befor i had entir finish my littl pale or surround my habit the pile or stake which were as heavi as i could well lift were a long time in cut and prepar in the wood and more by far in bring home so that i spent sometim two dai in cut and bring home on of those post and a third dai in drive it into the ground for which purpos i got a heavi piec of wood at first but at last bethought myself of on of the iron crow which howev though i found it made drive those post or pile veri labori and tediou work but what need i have been concern at the tedious of anyth i had to do see i had time enough to do it in nor had i ani other employ if that had been over at least that i could forese except the rang the island to seek for food which i did more or less everi dai i now began to consid serious my condit and the circumst i wa reduc to and i drew up the state of my affair in write not so much to leav them to ani that were to come after me for i wa like to have but few heir as to deliv my thought from daili pore over them and afflict my mind and as my reason began now to master my despond i began to comfort myself as well as i could and to set the good against the evil that i might have someth to distinguish my case from wors and i state veri imparti like debtor and creditor the comfort i enjoi against the miseri i suffer thu evil good i am cast upon a horribl but i am aliv and not drown desol island void of all hope as all my ship s compani were of recoveri i am singl out and separ but i am singl out too from as it were from all the world all the ship s crew to be spare to be miser from death and he that miracul save me from death can deliv me from thi condit i am divid from mankind a but i am not starv and solitair on banish from perish on a barren place human societi afford no susten i have no cloth to cover me but i am in a hot climat where if i had cloth i could hardli wear them i am without ani defenc or but i am cast on an island where mean to resist ani violenc of i see no wild beast to hurt me man or beast as i saw on the coast of africa and what if i had been shipwreck there i have no soul to speak to or but god wonderfulli sent the ship reliev me in near enough to the shore that i have got out as mani necessari thing as will either suppli my want or enabl me to suppli myself even as long as i live upon the whole here wa an undoubt testimoni that there wa scarc ani condit in the world so miser but there wa someth neg or someth posit to be thank for in it and let thi stand as a direct from the experi of the most miser of all condit in thi world that we mai alwai find in it someth to comfort ourselv from and to set in the descript of good and evil on the credit side of the account have now brought my mind a littl to relish my condit and given over look out to sea to see if i could spy a ship i sai give over these thing i began to appli myself to arrang my wai of live and to make thing as easi to me as i could i have alreadi describ my habit which wa a tent under the side of a rock surround with a strong pale of post and cabl but i might now rather call it a wall for i rais a kind of wall up against it of turf about two feet thick on the outsid and after some time i think it wa a year and a half i rais rafter from it lean to the rock and thatch or cover it with bough of tree and such thing as i could get to keep out the rain which i found at some time of the year veri violent i have alreadi observ how i brought all my good into thi pale and into the cave which i had made behind me but i must observ too that at first thi wa a confus heap of good which as thei lai in no order so thei took up all my place i had no room to turn myself so i set myself to enlarg my cave and work farther into the earth for it wa a loos sandi rock which yield easili to the labour i bestow on it and so when i found i wa pretti safe as to beast of prei i work sidewai to the right hand into the rock and then turn to the right again work quit out and made me a door to come out on the outsid of my pale or fortif thi gave me not onli egress and regress as it wa a back wai to my tent and to my storehous but gave me room to store my good and now i began to appli myself to make such necessari thing as i found i most want particularli a chair and a tabl for without these i wa not abl to enjoi the few comfort i had in the world i could not write or eat or do sever thing with so much pleasur without a tabl so i went to work and here i must need observ that as reason is the substanc and origin of the mathemat so by state and squar everyth by reason and by make the most ration judgment of thing everi man mai be in time master of everi mechan art i had never handl a tool in my life and yet in time by labour applic and contriv i found at last that i want noth but i could have made it especi if i had had tool howev i made abund of thing even without tool and some with no more tool than an adz and a hatchet which perhap were never made that wai befor and that with infinit labour for exampl if i want a board i had no other wai but to cut down a tree set it on an edg befor me and hew it flat on either side with my ax till i brought it to be thin as a plank and then dub it smooth with my adz it is true by thi method i could make but on board out of a whole tree but thi i had no remedi for but patienc ani more than i had for the prodigi deal of time and labour which it took me up to make a plank or board but my time or labour wa littl worth and so it wa as well emploi on wai as anoth howev i made me a tabl and a chair as i observ abov in the first place and thi i did out of the short piec of board that i brought on my raft from the ship but when i had wrought out some board as abov i made larg shelv of the breadth of a foot and a half on over anoth all along on side of my cave to lai all my tool nail and ironwork on and in a word to separ everyth at larg into their place that i might come easili at them i knock piec into the wall of the rock to hang my gun and all thing that would hang up so that had my cave been to be seen it look like a gener magazin of all necessari thing and had everyth so readi at my hand that it wa a great pleasur to me to see all my good in such order and especi to find my stock of all necessari so great and now it wa that i began to keep a journal of everi dai s employ for inde at first i wa in too much hurri and not onli hurri as to labour but in too much discomposur of mind and my journal would have been full of mani dull thing for exampl i must have said thu th after i had got to shore and escap drown instead of be thank to god for my deliver have first vomit with the great quantiti of salt water which had got into my stomach and recov myself a littl i ran about the shore wring my hand and beat my head and face exclaim at my miseri and cry out i wa undon undon till tire and faint i wa forc to lie down on the ground to repos but durst not sleep for fear of be devour some dai after thi and after i had been on board the ship and got all that i could out of her yet i could not forbear get up to the top of a littl mountain and look out to sea in hope of see a ship then fanci at a vast distanc i spi a sail pleas myself with the hope of it and then after look steadili till i wa almost blind lose it quit and sit down and weep like a child and thu increas my miseri by my folli but have gotten over these thing in some measur and have settl my household staff and habit made me a tabl and a chair and all as handsom about me as i could i began to keep my journal of which i shall here give you the copi though in it will be told all these particular over again as long as it last for have no more ink i wa forc to leav it off chapter v build a hous the journal septemb i poor miser robinson cruso be shipwreck dure a dread storm in the of came on shore on thi dismal unfortun island which i call the island of despair all the rest of the ship s compani be drown and myself almost dead all the rest of the dai i spent in afflict myself at the dismal circumst i wa brought to viz i had neither food hous cloth weapon nor place to fly to and in despair of ani relief saw noth but death befor me either that i should be devour by wild beast murder by savag or starv to death for want of food at the approach of night i slept in a tree for fear of wild creatur but slept soundli though it rain all night octob in the morn i saw to my great surpris the ship had float with the high tide and wa driven on shore again much nearer the island which as it wa some comfort on on hand for see her set upright and not broken to piec i hope if the wind abat i might get on board and get some food and necessari out of her for my relief so on the other hand it renew my grief at the loss of my comrad who i imagin if we had all stai on board might have save the ship or at least that thei would not have been all drown as thei were and that had the men been save we might perhap have built us a boat out of the ruin of the ship to have carri us to some other part of the world i spent great part of thi dai in perplex myself on these thing but at length see the ship almost dry i went upon the sand as near as i could and then swam on board thi dai also it continu rain though with no wind at all from the st of octob to the th all these dai entir spent in mani sever voyag to get all i could out of the ship which i brought on shore everi tide of flood upon raft much rain also in the dai though with some interv of fair weather but it seem thi wa the raini season oct i overset my raft and all the good i had got upon it but be in shoal water and the thing be chiefli heavi i recov mani of them when the tide wa out oct it rain all night and all dai with some gust of wind dure which time the ship broke in piec the wind blow a littl harder than befor and wa no more to be seen except the wreck of her and that onli at low water i spent thi dai in cover and secur the good which i had save that the rain might not spoil them oct i walk about the shore almost all dai to find out a place to fix my habit greatli concern to secur myself from ani attack in the night either from wild beast or men toward night i fix upon a proper place under a rock and mark out a semicircl for my encamp which i resolv to strengthen with a work wall or fortif made of doubl pile line within with cabl and without with turf from the th to the th i work veri hard in carri all my good to my new habit though some part of the time it rain exceedingli hard the st in the morn i went out into the island with my gun to seek for some food and discov the countri when i kill a she goat and her kid follow me home which i afterward kill also becaus it would not feed novemb i set up my tent under a rock and lai there for the first night make it as larg as i could with stake driven in to swing my hammock upon nov i set up all my chest and board and the piec of timber which made my raft and with them form a fenc round me a littl within the place i had mark out for my fortif nov i went out with my gun and kill two fowl like duck which were veri good food in the afternoon went to work to make me a tabl nov thi morn i began to order my time of work of go out with my gun time of sleep and time of divers viz everi morn i walk out with my gun for two or three hour if it did not rain then emploi myself to work till about eleven o clock then eat what i had to live on and from twelv to two i lai down to sleep the weather be excess hot and then in the even to work again the work part of thi dai and of the next were wholli emploi in make my tabl for i wa yet but a veri sorri workman though time and necess made me a complet natur mechan soon after as i believ thei would do ani on els nov thi dai went abroad with my gun and my dog and kill a wild cat her skin pretti soft but her flesh good for noth everi creatur that i kill i took of the skin and preserv them come back by the sea shore i saw mani sort of sea fowl which i did not understand but wa surpris and almost frighten with two or three seal which while i wa gaze at not well know what thei were got into the sea and escap me for that time nov after my morn walk i went to work with my tabl again and finish it though not to my like nor wa it long befor i learn to mend it nov now it began to be settl fair weather the th th th th and part of the th for the th wa sundai i took wholli up to make me a chair and with much ado brought it to a toler shape but never to pleas me and even in the make i pull it in piec sever time note i soon neglect my keep sundai for omit my mark for them on my post i forgot which wa which nov thi dai it rain which refresh me exceedingli and cool the earth but it wa accompani with terribl thunder and lightn which frighten me dreadfulli for fear of my powder as soon as it wa over i resolv to separ my stock of powder into as mani littl parcel as possibl that it might not be in danger nov these three dai i spent in make littl squar chest or box which might hold about a pound or two pound at most of powder and so put the powder in i stow it in place as secur and remot from on anoth as possibl on on of these three dai i kill a larg bird that wa good to eat but i knew not what to call it nov thi dai i began to dig behind my tent into the rock to make room for my further conveni note three thing i want exceedingli for thi work viz a pickax a shovel and a wheelbarrow or basket so i desist from my work and began to consid how to suppli that want and make me some tool as for the pickax i made us of the iron crow which were proper enough though heavi but the next thing wa a shovel or spade thi wa so absolut necessari that inde i could do noth effectu without it but what kind of on to make i knew not nov the next dai in search the wood i found a tree of that wood or like it which in the brazil thei call the iron tree for it exceed hard of thi with great labour and almost spoil my ax i cut a piec and brought it home too with difficulti enough for it wa exceed heavi the excess hard of the wood and my have no other wai made me a long while upon thi machin for i work it effectu by littl and littl into the form of a shovel or spade the handl exactli shape like our in england onli that the board part have no iron shod upon it at bottom it would not last me so long howev it serv well enough for the us which i had occas to put it to but never wa a shovel i believ made after that fashion or so long in make i wa still defici for i want a basket or a wheelbarrow a basket i could not make by ani mean have no such thing as twig that would bend to make wicker ware at least none yet found out and as to a wheelbarrow i fanci i could make all but the wheel but that i had no notion of neither did i know how to go about it besid i had no possibl wai to make the iron gudgeon for the spindl or axi of the wheel to run in so i gave it over and so for carri awai the earth which i dug out of the cave i made me a thing like a hod which the labour carri mortar in when thei serv the bricklay thi wa not so difficult to me as the make the shovel and yet thi and the shovel and the attempt which i made in vain to make a wheelbarrow took me up no less than four dai i mean alwai except my morn walk with my gun which i seldom fail and veri seldom fail also bring home someth fit to eat nov my other work have now stood still becaus of my make these tool when thei were finish i went on and work everi dai as my strength and time allow i spent eighteen dai entir in widen and deepen my cave that it might hold my good commodi note dure all thi time i work to make thi room or cave spaciou enough to accommod me as a warehous or magazin a kitchen a dine room and a cellar as for my lodg i kept to the tent except that sometim in the wet season of the year it rain so hard that i could not keep myself dry which caus me afterward to cover all my place within my pale with long pole in the form of rafter lean against the rock and load them with flag and larg leav of tree like a thatch decemb i began now to think my cave or vault finish when on a sudden it seem i had made it too larg a great quantiti of earth fell down from the top on on side so much that in short it fright me and not without reason too for if i had been under it i had never want a gravedigg i had now a great deal of work to do over again for i had the loos earth to carri out and which wa of more import i had the ceil to prop up so that i might be sure no more would come down dec thi dai i went to work with it accordingli and got two shore or post pitch upright to the top with two piec of board across over each post thi i finish the next dai and set more post up with board in about a week more i had the roof secur and the post stand in row serv me for partit to part off the hous dec from thi dai to the th i place shelv and knock up nail on the post to hang everyth up that could be hung up and now i began to be in some order within door dec now i carri everyth into the cave and began to furnish my hous and set up some piec of board like a dresser to order my victual upon but board began to be veri scarc with me also i made me anoth tabl dec much rain all night and all dai no stir out dec rain all dai dec no rain and the earth much cooler than befor and pleasant dec kill a young goat and lame anoth so that i caught it and led it home in a string when i had it at home i bound and splinter up it leg which wa broke n b i took such care of it that it live and the leg grew well and as strong as ever but by my nurs it so long it grew tame and fed upon the littl green at my door and would not go awai thi wa the first time that i entertain a thought of breed up some tame creatur that i might have food when my powder and shot wa all spent dec great heat and no breez so that there wa no stir abroad except in the even for food thi time i spent in put all my thing in order within door januari veri hot still but i went abroad earli and late with my gun and lai still in the middl of the dai thi even go farther into the vallei which lai toward the centr of the island i found there were plenti of goat though exceedingli shy and hard to come at howev i resolv to try if i could not bring my dog to hunt them down jan accordingli the next dai i went out with my dog and set him upon the goat but i wa mistaken for thei all face about upon the dog and he knew hi danger too well for he would not come near them jan i began my fenc or wall which be still jealou of my be attack by somebodi i resolv to make veri thick and strong n b thi wall be describ befor i purpos omit what wa said in the journal it is suffici to observ that i wa no less time than from the nd of januari to the th of april work finish and perfect thi wall though it wa no more than about twenti four yard in length be a half circl from on place in the rock to anoth place about eight yard from it the door of the cave be in the centr behind it all thi time i work veri hard the rain hinder me mani dai nai sometim week togeth but i thought i should never be perfectli secur till thi wall wa finish and it is scarc credibl what inexpress labour everyth wa done with especi the bring pile out of the wood and drive them into the ground for i made them much bigger than i need to have done when thi wall wa finish and the outsid doubl fenc with a turf wall rais up close to it i perceiv myself that if ani peopl were to come on shore there thei would not perceiv anyth like a habit and it wa veri well i did so as mai be observ hereaft upon a veri remark occas dure thi time i made my round in the wood for game everi dai when the rain permit me and made frequent discoveri in these walk of someth or other to my advantag particularli i found a kind of wild pigeon which build not as wood pigeon in a tree but rather as hous pigeon in the hole of the rock and take some young on i endeavour to breed them up tame and did so but when thei grew older thei flew awai which perhap wa at first for want of feed them for i had noth to give them howev i frequent found their nest and got their young on which were veri good meat and now in the manag my household affair i found myself want in mani thing which i thought at first it wa imposs for me to make as inde with some of them it wa for instanc i could never make a cask to be hoop i had a small runlet or two as i observ befor but i could never arriv at the capac of make on by them though i spent mani week about it i could neither put in the head or join the stave so true to on anoth as to make them hold water so i gave that also over in the next place i wa at a great loss for candl so that as soon as ever it wa dark which wa gener by seven o clock i wa oblig to go to bed i rememb the lump of beeswax with which i made candl in my african adventur but i had none of that now the onli remedi i had wa that when i had kill a goat i save the tallow and with a littl dish made of clai which i bake in the sun to which i ad a wick of some oakum i made me a lamp and thi gave me light though not a clear steadi light like a candl in the middl of all my labour it happen that rummag my thing i found a littl bag which as i hint befor had been fill with corn for the feed of poultri not for thi voyag but befor as i suppos when the ship came from lisbon the littl remaind of corn that had been in the bag wa all devour by the rat and i saw noth in the bag but husk and dust and be will to have the bag for some other us i think it wa to put powder in when i divid it for fear of the lightn or some such us i shook the husk of corn out of it on on side of my fortif under the rock it wa a littl befor the great rain just now mention that i threw thi stuff awai take no notic and not so much as rememb that i had thrown anyth there when about a month after or thereabout i saw some few stalk of someth green shoot out of the ground which i fanci might be some plant i had not seen but i wa surpris and perfectli astonish when after a littl longer time i saw about ten or twelv ear come out which were perfect green barlei of the same kind as our european nai as our english barlei it is imposs to express the astonish and confus of my thought on thi occas i had hitherto act upon no religi foundat at all inde i had veri few notion of religion in my head nor had entertain ani sens of anyth that had befallen me otherwis than as chanc or as we lightli sai what pleas god without so much as inquir into the end of provid in these thing or hi order in govern event for the world but after i saw barlei grow there in a climat which i knew wa not proper for corn and especi that i knew not how it came there it startl me strang and i began to suggest that god had miracul caus hi grain to grow without ani help of seed sown and that it wa so direct pure for my susten on that wild miser place thi touch my heart a littl and brought tear out of my ey and i began to bless myself that such a prodigi of natur should happen upon my account and thi wa the more strang to me becaus i saw near it still all along by the side of the rock some other straggl stalk which prove to be stalk of rice and which i knew becaus i had seen it grow in africa when i wa ashor there i not onli thought these the pure product of provid for my support but not doubt that there wa more in the place i went all over that part of the island where i had been befor peer in everi corner and under everi rock to see for more of it but i could not find ani at last it occur to my thought that i shook a bag of chicken meat out in that place and then the wonder began to ceas and i must confess my religi thank to god s provid began to abat too upon the discov that all thi wa noth but what wa common though i ought to have been as thank for so strang and unforeseen a provid as if it had been miracul for it wa realli the work of provid to me that should order or appoint that ten or twelv grain of corn should remain unspoil when the rat had destroi all the rest as if it had been drop from heaven as also that i should throw it out in that particular place where it be in the shade of a high rock it sprang up immedi wherea if i had thrown it anywher els at that time it had been burnt up and destroi i carefulli save the ear of thi corn you mai be sure in their season which wa about the end of june and lai up everi corn i resolv to sow them all again hope in time to have some quantiti suffici to suppli me with bread but it wa not till the fourth year that i could allow myself the least grain of thi corn to eat and even then but sparingli as i shall sai afterward in it order for i lost all that i sow the first season by not observ the proper time for i sow it just befor the dry season so that it never came up at all at least not as it would have done of which in it place besid thi barlei there were as abov twenti or thirti stalk of rice which i preserv with the same care and for the same us or to the same purpos to make me bread or rather food for i found wai to cook it without bake though i did that also after some time but to return to my journal i work excess hard these three or four month to get my wall done and the th of april i close it up contriv to go into it not by a door but over the wall by a ladder that there might be no sign on the outsid of my habit april i finish the ladder so i went up the ladder to the top and then pull it up after me and let it down in the insid thi wa a complet enclosur to me for within i had room enough and noth could come at me from without unless it could first mount my wall the veri next dai after thi wall wa finish i had almost had all my labour overthrown at onc and myself kill the case wa thu as i wa busi in the insid behind my tent just at the entranc into my cave i wa terribl fright with a most dread surpris thing inde for all on a sudden i found the earth come crumbl down from the roof of my cave and from the edg of the hill over my head and two of the post i had set up in the cave crack in a fright manner i wa heartili scare but thought noth of what wa realli the caus onli think that the top of my cave wa fallen in as some of it had done befor and for fear i should be buri in it i ran forward to my ladder and not think myself safe there neither i got over my wall for fear of the piec of the hill which i expect might roll down upon me i had no sooner step down upon the firm ground than i plainli saw it wa a terribl earthquak for the ground i stood on shook three time at about eight minut distanc with three such shock as would have overturn the strongest build that could be suppos to have stood on the earth and a great piec of the top of a rock which stood about half a mile from me next the sea fell down with such a terribl nois as i never heard in all my life i perceiv also the veri sea wa put into violent motion by it and i believ the shock were stronger under the water than on the island i wa so much amaz with the thing itself have never felt the like nor discours with ani on that had that i wa like on dead or stupefi and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick like on that wa toss at sea but the nois of the fall of the rock awaken me as it were and rous me from the stupefi condit i wa in fill me with horror and i thought of noth then but the hill fall upon my tent and all my household good and buri all at onc and thi sunk my veri soul within me a second time after the third shock wa over and i felt no more for some time i began to take courag and yet i had not heart enough to go over my wall again for fear of be buri aliv but sat still upon the ground greatli cast down and disconsol not know what to do all thi while i had not the least seriou religi thought noth but the common lord have merci upon me and when it wa over that went awai too while i sat thu i found the air overcast and grow cloudi as if it would rain soon after that the wind aros by littl and littl so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dread hurrican the sea wa all on a sudden cover over with foam and froth the shore wa cover with the breach of the water the tree were torn up by the root and a terribl storm it wa thi held about three hour and then began to abat and in two hour more it wa quit calm and began to rain veri hard all thi while i sat upon the ground veri much terrifi and deject when on a sudden it came into my thought that these wind and rain be the consequ of the earthquak the earthquak itself wa spent and over and i might ventur into my cave again with thi thought my spirit began to reviv and the rain also help to persuad me i went in and sat down in my tent but the rain wa so violent that my tent wa readi to be beaten down with it and i wa forc to go into my cave though veri much afraid and uneasi for fear it should fall on my head thi violent rain forc me to a new work viz to cut a hole through my new fortif like a sink to let the water go out which would els have flood my cave after i had been in my cave for some time and found still no more shock of the earthquak follow i began to be more compos and now to support my spirit which inde want it veri much i went to my littl store and took a small sup of rum which howev i did then and alwai veri sparingli know i could have no more when that wa gone it continu rain all that night and great part of the next dai so that i could not stir abroad but my mind be more compos i began to think of what i had best do conclud that if the island wa subject to these earthquak there would be no live for me in a cave but i must consid of build a littl hut in an open place which i might surround with a wall as i had done here and so make myself secur from wild beast or men for i conclud if i stai where i wa i should certainli on time or other be buri aliv with these thought i resolv to remov my tent from the place where it stood which wa just under the hang precipic of the hill and which if it should be shaken again would certainli fall upon my tent and i spent the two next dai be the th and th of april in contriv where and how to remov my habit the fear of be swallow up aliv made me that i never slept in quiet and yet the apprehens of ly abroad without ani fenc wa almost equal to it but still when i look about and saw how everyth wa put in order how pleasantli conceal i wa and how safe from danger it made me veri loath to remov in the meantim it occur to me that it would requir a vast deal of time for me to do thi and that i must be content to ventur where i wa till i had form a camp for myself and had secur it so as to remov to it so with thi resolut i compos myself for a time and resolv that i would go to work with all speed to build me a wall with pile and cabl c in a circl as befor and set my tent up in it when it wa finish but that i would ventur to stai where i wa till it wa finish and fit to remov thi wa the st april the next morn i begin to consid of mean to put thi resolv into execut but i wa at a great loss about my tool i had three larg ax and abund of hatchet for we carri the hatchet for traffic with the indian but with much chop and cut knotti hard wood thei were all full of notch and dull and though i had a grindston i could not turn it and grind my tool too thi cost me as much thought as a statesman would have bestow upon a grand point of polit or a judg upon the life and death of a man at length i contriv a wheel with a string to turn it with my foot that i might have both my hand at liberti note i had never seen ani such thing in england or at least not to take notic how it wa done though sinc i have observ it is veri common there besid that my grindston wa veri larg and heavi thi machin cost me a full week s work to bring it to perfect april these two whole dai i took up in grind my tool my machin for turn my grindston perform veri well april have perceiv my bread had been low a great while now i took a survei of it and reduc myself to on biscuit cake a dai which made my heart veri heavi mai in the morn look toward the sea side the tide be low i saw someth lie on the shore bigger than ordinari and it look like a cask when i came to it i found a small barrel and two or three piec of the wreck of the ship which were driven on shore by the late hurrican and look toward the wreck itself i thought it seem to lie higher out of the water than it us to do i examin the barrel which wa driven on shore and soon found it wa a barrel of gunpowd but it had taken water and the powder wa cake as hard as a stone howev i roll it farther on shore for the present and went on upon the sand as near as i could to the wreck of the ship to look for more chapter vi ill and conscienc stricken when i came down to the ship i found it strang remov the forecastl which lai befor buri in sand wa heav up at least six feet and the stern which wa broke in piec and part from the rest by the forc of the sea soon after i had left rummag her wa toss as it were up and cast on on side and the sand wa thrown so high on that side next her stern that wherea there wa a great place of water befor so that i could not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swim i could now walk quit up to her when the tide wa out i wa surpris with thi at first but soon conclud it must be done by the earthquak and as by thi violenc the ship wa more broke open than formerli so mani thing came daili on shore which the sea had loosen and which the wind and water roll by degre to the land thi wholli divert my thought from the design of remov my habit and i busi myself mightili that dai especi in search whether i could make ani wai into the ship but i found noth wa to be expect of that kind for all the insid of the ship wa choke up with sand howev as i had learn not to despair of anyth i resolv to pull everyth to piec that i could of the ship conclud that everyth i could get from her would be of some us or other to me mai i began with my saw and cut a piec of a beam through which i thought held some of the upper part or quarter deck togeth and when i had cut it through i clear awai the sand as well as i could from the side which lai highest but the tide come in i wa oblig to give over for that time mai i went a fish but caught not on fish that i durst eat of till i wa weari of my sport when just go to leav off i caught a young dolphin i had made me a long line of some rope yarn but i had no hook yet i frequent caught fish enough as much as i care to eat all which i dri in the sun and at them dry mai work on the wreck cut anoth beam asund and brought three great fir plank off from the deck which i ti togeth and made to float on shore when the tide of flood came on mai work on the wreck got sever iron bolt out of her and other piec of ironwork work veri hard and came home veri much tire and had thought of give it over mai went to the wreck again not with an intent to work but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down the beam be cut that sever piec of the ship seem to lie loos and the insid of the hold lai so open that i could see into it but it wa almost full of water and sand mai went to the wreck and carri an iron crow to wrench up the deck which lai now quit clear of the water or sand i wrench open two plank and brought them on shore also with the tide i left the iron crow in the wreck for next dai mai went to the wreck and with the crow made wai into the bodi of the wreck and felt sever cask and loosen them with the crow but could not break them up i felt also a roll of english lead and could stir it but it wa too heavi to remov mai went everi dai to the wreck and got a great mani piec of timber and board or plank and two or three hundredweight of iron mai i carri two hatchet to try if i could not cut a piec off the roll of lead by place the edg of on hatchet and drive it with the other but as it lai about a foot and a half in the water i could not make ani blow to drive the hatchet mai it had blown hard in the night and the wreck appear more broken by the forc of the water but i stai so long in the wood to get pigeon for food that the tide prevent my go to the wreck that dai mai i saw some piec of the wreck blown on shore at a great distanc near two mile off me but resolv to see what thei were and found it wa a piec of the head but too heavi for me to bring awai mai everi dai to thi dai i work on the wreck and with hard labour i loosen some thing so much with the crow that the first flow tide sever cask float out and two of the seamen s chest but the wind blow from the shore noth came to land that dai but piec of timber and a hogshead which had some brazil pork in it but the salt water and the sand had spoil it i continu thi work everi dai to the th of june except the time necessari to get food which i alwai appoint dure thi part of my employ to be when the tide wa up that i might be readi when it wa eb out and by thi time i had got timber and plank and ironwork enough to have built a good boat if i had known how and also i got at sever time and in sever piec near on hundredweight of the sheet lead june go down to the seasid i found a larg tortois or turtl thi wa the first i had seen which it seem wa onli my misfortun not ani defect of the place or scarciti for had i happen to be on the other side of the island i might have had hundr of them everi dai as i found afterward but perhap had paid dear enough for them june i spent in cook the turtl i found in her three score egg and her flesh wa to me at that time the most savouri and pleasant that ever i tast in my life have had no flesh but of goat and fowl sinc i land in thi horrid place june rain all dai and i stai within i thought at thi time the rain felt cold and i wa someth chilli which i knew wa not usual in that latitud june veri ill and shiver as if the weather had been cold june no rest all night violent pain in my head and feverish june veri ill fright almost to death with the apprehens of my sad condit to be sick and no help prai to god for the first time sinc the storm off hull but scarc knew what i said or why my thought be all confus june a littl better but under dread apprehens of sick june veri bad again cold and shiver and then a violent headach june much better june an agu veri violent the fit held me seven hour cold fit and hot with faint sweat after it june better and have no victual to eat took my gun but found myself veri weak howev i kill a she goat and with much difficulti got it home and broil some of it and at i would fain have stew it and made some broth but had no pot june the agu again so violent that i lai a bed all dai and neither at nor drank i wa readi to perish for thirst but so weak i had not strength to stand up or to get myself ani water to drink prai to god again but wa light head and when i wa not i wa so ignor that i knew not what to sai onli i lai and cri lord look upon me lord piti me lord have merci upon me i suppos i did noth els for two or three hour till the fit wear off i fell asleep and did not wake till far in the night when i awok i found myself much refresh but weak and exceed thirsti howev as i had no water in my habit i wa forc to lie till morn and went to sleep again in thi second sleep i had thi terribl dream i thought that i wa sit on the ground on the outsid of my wall where i sat when the storm blew after the earthquak and that i saw a man descend from a great black cloud in a bright flame of fire and light upon the ground he wa all over as bright as a flame so that i could but just bear to look toward him hi counten wa most inexpress dread imposs for word to describ when he step upon the ground with hi feet i thought the earth trembl just as it had done befor in the earthquak and all the air look to my apprehens as if it had been fill with flash of fire he wa no sooner land upon the earth but he move forward toward me with a long spear or weapon in hi hand to kill me and when he came to a rise ground at some distanc he spoke to me or i heard a voic so terribl that it is imposs to express the terror of it all that i can sai i understood wa thi see all these thing have not brought thee to repent now thou shalt die at which word i thought he lift up the spear that wa in hi hand to kill me no on that shall ever read thi account will expect that i should be abl to describ the horror of my soul at thi terribl vision i mean that even while it wa a dream i even dream of those horror nor is it ani more possibl to describ the impress that remain upon my mind when i awak and found it wa but a dream i had ala no divin knowledg what i had receiv by the good instruct of my father wa then worn out by an uninterrupt seri for eight year of seafar wicked and a constant convers with none but such as were like myself wick and profan to the last degre i do not rememb that i had in all that time on thought that so much as tend either to look upward toward god or inward toward a reflect upon my own wai but a certain stupid of soul without desir of good or conscienc of evil had entir overwhelm me and i wa all that the most harden unthink wick creatur among our common sailor can be suppos to be not have the least sens either of the fear of god in danger or of thank to god in deliver in the relat what is alreadi past of my stori thi will be the more easili believ when i shall add that through all the varieti of miseri that had to thi dai befallen me i never had so much as on thought of it be the hand of god or that it wa a just punish for my sin my rebelli behaviour against my father or my present sin which were great or so much as a punish for the gener cours of my wick life when i wa on the desper expedit on the desert shore of africa i never had so much as on thought of what would becom of me or on wish to god to direct me whither i should go or to keep me from the danger which appar surround me as well from voraci creatur as cruel savag but i wa mere thoughtless of a god or a provid act like a mere brute from the principl of natur and by the dictat of common sens onli and inde hardli that when i wa deliv and taken up at sea by the portug captain well us and dealt justli and honour with as well as charit i had not the least thank in my thought when again i wa shipwreck ruin and in danger of drown on thi island i wa as far from remors or look on it as a judgment i onli said to myself often that i wa an unfortun dog and born to be alwai miser it is true when i got on shore first here and found all my ship s crew drown and myself spare i wa surpris with a kind of ecstasi and some transport of soul which had the grace of god assist might have come up to true thank but it end where it began in a mere common flight of joi or as i mai sai be glad i wa aliv without the least reflect upon the distinguish good of the hand which had preserv me and had singl me out to be preserv when all the rest were destroi or an inquiri why provid had been thu merci unto me even just the same common sort of joi which seamen gener have after thei ar got safe ashor from a shipwreck which thei drown all in the next bowl of punch and forget almost as soon as it is over and all the rest of my life wa like it even when i wa afterward on due consider made sensibl of my condit how i wa cast on thi dread place out of the reach of human kind out of all hope of relief or prospect of redempt as soon as i saw but a prospect of live and that i should not starv and perish for hunger all the sens of my afflict wore off and i began to be veri easi appli myself to the work proper for my preserv and suppli and wa far enough from be afflict at my condit as a judgment from heaven or as the hand of god against me these were thought which veri seldom enter my head the grow up of the corn as is hint in my journal had at first some littl influenc upon me and began to affect me with serious as long as i thought it had someth miracul in it but as soon as ever that part of the thought wa remov all the impress that wa rais from it wore off also as i have note alreadi even the earthquak though noth could be more terribl in it natur or more immedi direct to the invis power which alon direct such thing yet no sooner wa the first fright over but the impress it had made went off also i had no more sens of god or hi judgment much less of the present afflict of my circumst be from hi hand than if i had been in the most prosper condit of life but now when i began to be sick and a leisur view of the miseri of death came to place itself befor me when my spirit began to sink under the burden of a strong distemp and natur wa exhaust with the violenc of the fever conscienc that had slept so long began to awak and i began to reproach myself with my past life in which i had so evid by uncommon wicked provok the justic of god to lai me under uncommon stroke and to deal with me in so vindict a manner these reflect oppress me for the second or third dai of my distemp and in the violenc as well of the fever as of the dread reproach of my conscienc extort some word from me like prai to god though i cannot sai thei were either a prayer attend with desir or with hope it wa rather the voic of mere fright and distress my thought were confus the convict great upon my mind and the horror of dy in such a miser condit rais vapour into my head with the mere apprehens and in these hurri of my soul i knew not what my tongu might express but it wa rather exclam such as lord what a miser creatur am i if i should be sick i shall certainli die for want of help and what will becom of me then the tear burst out of my ey and i could sai no more for a good while in thi interv the good advic of my father came to my mind and present hi predict which i mention at the begin of thi stori viz that if i did take thi foolish step god would not bless me and i would have leisur hereaft to reflect upon have neglect hi counsel when there might be none to assist in my recoveri now said i aloud my dear father s word ar come to pass god s justic ha overtaken me and i have none to help or hear me i reject the voic of provid which had mercifulli put me in a postur or station of life wherein i might have been happi and easi but i would neither see it myself nor learn to know the bless of it from my parent i left them to mourn over my folli and now i am left to mourn under the consequ of it i abus their help and assist who would have lift me in the world and would have made everyth easi to me and now i have difficulti to struggl with too great for even natur itself to support and no assist no help no comfort no advic then i cri out lord be my help for i am in great distress thi wa the first prayer if i mai call it so that i had made for mani year but to return to my journal june have been somewhat refresh with the sleep i had had and the fit be entir off i got up and though the fright and terror of my dream wa veri great yet i consid that the fit of the agu would return again the next dai and now wa my time to get someth to refresh and support myself when i should be ill and the first thing i did i fill a larg squar case bottl with water and set it upon my tabl in reach of my bed and to take off the chill or aguish disposit of the water i put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it and mix them togeth then i got me a piec of the goat s flesh and broil it on the coal but could eat veri littl i walk about but wa veri weak and withal veri sad and heavi heart under a sens of my miser condit dread the return of my distemp the next dai at night i made my supper of three of the turtl s egg which i roast in the ash and at as we call it in the shell and thi wa the first bit of meat i had ever ask god s bless to that i could rememb in my whole life after i had eaten i tri to walk but found myself so weak that i could hardli carri a gun for i never went out without that so i went but a littl wai and sat down upon the ground look out upon the sea which wa just befor me and veri calm and smooth as i sat here some such thought as these occur to me what is thi earth and sea of which i have seen so much whenc is it produc and what am i and all the other creatur wild and tame human and brutal whenc ar we sure we ar all made by some secret power who form the earth and sea the air and sky and who is that then it follow most natur it is god that ha made all well but then it came on strang if god ha made all these thing he guid and govern them all and all thing that concern them for the power that could make all thing must certainli have power to guid and direct them if so noth can happen in the great circuit of hi work either without hi knowledg or appoint and if noth happen without hi knowledg he know that i am here and am in thi dread condit and if noth happen without hi appoint he ha appoint all thi to befal me noth occur to my thought to contradict ani of these conclus and therefor it rest upon me with the greater forc that it must need be that god had appoint all thi to befal me that i wa brought into thi miser circumst by hi direct he have the sole power not of me onli but of everyth that happen in the world immedi it follow why ha god done thi to me what have i done to be thu us my conscienc present check me in that inquiri as if i had blasphem and methought it spoke to me like a voic wretch dost thou ask what thou hast done look back upon a dread misspent life and ask thyself what thou hast not done ask why is it that thou wert not long ago destroi why wert thou not drown in yarmouth road kill in the fight when the ship wa taken by the salle man of war devour by the wild beast on the coast of africa or drown here when all the crew perish but thyself dost thou ask what have i done i wa struck dumb with these reflect as on astonish and had not a word to sai no not to answer to myself but rose up pensiv and sad walk back to my retreat and went up over my wall as if i had been go to bed but my thought were sadli disturb and i had no inclin to sleep so i sat down in my chair and light my lamp for it began to be dark now as the apprehens of the return of my distemp terrifi me veri much it occur to my thought that the brazilian take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distemp and i had a piec of a roll of tobacco in on of the chest which wa quit cure and some also that wa green and not quit cure i went direct by heaven no doubt for in thi chest i found a cure both for soul and bodi i open the chest and found what i look for the tobacco and as the few book i had save lai there too i took out on of the bibl which i mention befor and which to thi time i had not found leisur or inclin to look into i sai i took it out and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the tabl what us to make of the tobacco i knew not in my distemp or whether it wa good for it or no but i tri sever experi with it as if i wa resolv it should hit on wai or other i first took a piec of leaf and chew it in my mouth which inde at first almost stupefi my brain the tobacco be green and strong and that i had not been much us to then i took some and steep it an hour or two in some rum and resolv to take a dose of it when i lai down and lastli i burnt some upon a pan of coal and held my nose close over the smoke of it as long as i could bear it as well for the heat as almost for suffoc in the interv of thi oper i took up the bibl and began to read but my head wa too much disturb with the tobacco to bear read at least at that time onli have open the book casual the first word that occur to me were these call on me in the dai of troubl and i will deliv thee and thou shalt glorifi me these word were veri apt to my case and made some impress upon my thought at the time of read them though not so much as thei did afterward for as for be deliv the word had no sound as i mai sai to me the thing wa so remot so imposs in my apprehens of thing that i began to sai as the children of israel did when thei were promis flesh to eat can god spread a tabl in the wilder so i began to sai can god himself deliv me from thi place and as it wa not for mani year that ani hope appear thi prevail veri often upon my thought but howev the word made a great impress upon me and i muse upon them veri often it grew now late and the tobacco had as i said doze my head so much that i inclin to sleep so i left my lamp burn in the cave lest i should want anyth in the night and went to bed but befor i lai down i did what i never had done in all my life i kneel down and prai to god to fulfil the promis to me that if i call upon him in the dai of troubl he would deliv me after my broken and imperfect prayer wa over i drank the rum in which i had steep the tobacco which wa so strong and rank of the tobacco that i could scarc get it down immedi upon thi i went to bed i found present it flew up into my head violent but i fell into a sound sleep and wake no more till by the sun it must necessarili be near three o clock in the afternoon the next dai nai to thi hour i am partli of opinion that i slept all the next dai and night and till almost three the dai after for otherwis i know not how i should lose a dai out of my reckon in the dai of the week as it appear some year after i had done for if i had lost it by cross and recross the line i should have lost more than on dai but certainli i lost a dai in my account and never knew which wai be that howev on wai or the other when i awak i found myself exceedingli refresh and my spirit live and cheer when i got up i wa stronger than i wa the dai befor and my stomach better for i wa hungri and in short i had no fit the next dai but continu much alter for the better thi wa the th the th wa my well dai of cours and i went abroad with my gun but did not care to travel too far i kill a sea fowl or two someth like a brandgoos and brought them home but wa not veri forward to eat them so i at some more of the turtl s egg which were veri good thi even i renew the medicin which i had suppos did me good the dai befor the tobacco steep in rum onli i did not take so much as befor nor did i chew ani of the leaf or hold my head over the smoke howev i wa not so well the next dai which wa the first of juli as i hope i should have been for i had a littl spice of the cold fit but it wa not much juli i renew the medicin all the three wai and dose myself with it as at first and doubl the quantiti which i drank juli i miss the fit for good and all though i did not recov my full strength for some week after while i wa thu gather strength my thought ran exceedingli upon thi scriptur i will deliv thee and the imposs of my deliver lai much upon my mind in bar of my ever expect it but as i wa discourag myself with such thought it occur to my mind that i pore so much upon my deliver from the main afflict that i disregard the deliver i had receiv and i wa as it were made to ask myself such question as these viz have i not been deliv and wonderfulli too from sick from the most distress condit that could be and that wa so fright to me and what notic had i taken of it had i done my part god had deliv me but i had not glorifi him that is to sai i had not own and been thank for that as a deliver and how could i expect greater deliver thi touch my heart veri much and immedi i knelt down and gave god thank aloud for my recoveri from my sick juli in the morn i took the bibl and begin at the new testament i began serious to read it and impos upon myself to read a while everi morn and everi night not ty myself to the number of chapter but long as my thought should engag me it wa not long after i set serious to thi work till i found my heart more deepli and sincer affect with the wicked of my past life the impress of my dream reviv and the word all these thing have not brought thee to repent ran serious through my thought i wa earnestli beg of god to give me repent when it happen providenti the veri dai that read the scriptur i came to these word he is exalt a princ and a saviour to give repent and to give remiss i threw down the book and with my heart as well as my hand lift up to heaven in a kind of ecstasi of joi i cri out aloud jesu thou son of david jesu thou exalt princ and saviour give me repent thi wa the first time i could sai in the true sens of the word that i prai in all my life for now i prai with a sens of my condit and a true scriptur view of hope found on the encourag of the word of god and from thi time i mai sai i began to hope that god would hear me now i began to constru the word mention abov call on me and i will deliv thee in a differ sens from what i had ever done befor for then i had no notion of anyth be call deliver but my be deliv from the captiv i wa in for though i wa inde at larg in the place yet the island wa certainli a prison to me and that in the wors sens in the world but now i learn to take it in anoth sens now i look back upon my past life with such horror and my sin appear so dread that my soul sought noth of god but deliver from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort as for my solitari life it wa noth i did not so much as prai to be deliv from it or think of it it wa all of no consider in comparison to thi and i add thi part here to hint to whoever shall read it that whenev thei come to a true sens of thing thei will find deliver from sin a much greater bless than deliver from afflict but leav thi part i return to my journal my condit began now to be though not less miser as to my wai of live yet much easier to my mind and my thought be direct by a constant read the scriptur and prai to god to thing of a higher natur i had a great deal of comfort within which till now i knew noth of also my health and strength return i bestir myself to furnish myself with everyth that i want and make my wai of live as regular as i could from the th of juli to the th i wa chiefli emploi in walk about with my gun in my hand a littl and a littl at a time as a man that wa gather up hi strength after a fit of sick for it is hardli to be imagin how low i wa and to what weak i wa reduc the applic which i made us of wa perfectli new and perhap which had never cure an agu befor neither can i recommend it to ani to practis by thi experi and though it did carri off the fit yet it rather contribut to weaken me for i had frequent convuls in my nerv and limb for some time i learn from it also thi in particular that be abroad in the raini season wa the most pernici thing to my health that could be especi in those rain which came attend with storm and hurrican of wind for as the rain which came in the dry season wa almost alwai accompani with such storm so i found that rain wa much more danger than the rain which fell in septemb and octob chapter vii agricultur experi i had now been in thi unhappi island abov ten month all possibl of deliver from thi condit seem to be entir taken from me and i firmli believ that no human shape had ever set foot upon that place have now secur my habit as i thought fulli to my mind i had a great desir to make a more perfect discoveri of the island and to see what other product i might find which i yet knew noth of it wa on the th of juli that i began to take a more particular survei of the island itself i went up the creek first where as i hint i brought my raft on shore i found after i came about two mile up that the tide did not flow ani higher and that it wa no more than a littl brook of run water veri fresh and good but thi be the dry season there wa hardli ani water in some part of it at least not enough to run in ani stream so as it could be perceiv on the bank of thi brook i found mani pleasant savannah or meadow plain smooth and cover with grass and on the rise part of them next to the higher ground where the water as might be suppos never overflow i found a great deal of tobacco green and grow to a great and veri strong stalk there were diver other plant which i had no notion of or understand about that might perhap have virtu of their own which i could not find out i search for the cassava root which the indian in all that climat make their bread of but i could find none i saw larg plant of alo but did not understand them i saw sever sugar cane but wild and for want of cultiv imperfect i content myself with these discoveri for thi time and came back muse with myself what cours i might take to know the virtu and good of ani of the fruit or plant which i should discov but could bring it to no conclus for in short i had made so littl observ while i wa in the brazil that i knew littl of the plant in the field at least veri littl that might serv to ani purpos now in my distress the next dai the sixteenth i went up the same wai again and after go someth further than i had gone the dai befor i found the brook and the savannah ceas and the countri becom more woodi than befor in thi part i found differ fruit and particularli i found melon upon the ground in great abund and grape upon the tree the vine had spread inde over the tree and the cluster of grape were just now in their prime veri ripe and rich thi wa a surpris discoveri and i wa exceed glad of them but i wa warn by my experi to eat sparingli of them rememb that when i wa ashor in barbari the eat of grape kill sever of our englishmen who were slave there by throw them into flux and fever but i found an excel us for these grape and that wa to cure or dry them in the sun and keep them as dri grape or raisin ar kept which i thought would be as inde thei were wholesom and agreeabl to eat when no grape could be had i spent all that even there and went not back to my habit which by the wai wa the first night as i might sai i had lain from home in the night i took my first contriv and got up in a tree where i slept well and the next morn proceed upon my discoveri travel nearli four mile as i might judg by the length of the vallei keep still due north with a ridg of hill on the south and north side of me at the end of thi march i came to an open where the countri seem to descend to the west and a littl spring of fresh water which issu out of the side of the hill by me ran the other wai that is due east and the countri appear so fresh so green so flourish everyth be in a constant verdur or flourish of spring that it look like a plant garden i descend a littl on the side of that delici vale survei it with a secret kind of pleasur though mix with my other afflict thought to think that thi wa all my own that i wa king and lord of all thi countri indefens and had a right of possess and if i could convei it i might have it in inherit as complet as ani lord of a manor in england i saw here abund of cocoa tree orang and lemon and citron tree but all wild and veri few bear ani fruit at least not then howev the green lime that i gather were not onli pleasant to eat but veri wholesom and i mix their juic afterward with water which made it veri wholesom and veri cool and refresh i found now i had busi enough to gather and carri home and i resolv to lai up a store as well of grape as lime and lemon to furnish myself for the wet season which i knew wa approach in order to do thi i gather a great heap of grape in on place a lesser heap in anoth place and a great parcel of lime and lemon in anoth place and take a few of each with me i travel homeward resolv to come again and bring a bag or sack or what i could make to carri the rest home accordingli have spent three dai in thi journei i came home so i must now call my tent and my cave but befor i got thither the grape were spoil the rich of the fruit and the weight of the juic have broken them and bruis them thei were good for littl or noth as to the lime thei were good but i could bring but a few the next dai be the nineteenth i went back have made me two small bag to bring home my harvest but i wa surpris when come to my heap of grape which were so rich and fine when i gather them to find them all spread about trod to piec and drag about some here some there and abund eaten and devour by thi i conclud there were some wild creatur thereabout which had done thi but what thei were i knew not howev as i found there wa no lai them up on heap and no carri them awai in a sack but that on wai thei would be destroi and the other wai thei would be crush with their own weight i took anoth cours for i gather a larg quantiti of the grape and hung upon the out branch of the tree that thei might cure and dry in the sun and as for the lime and lemon i carri as mani back as i could well stand under when i came home from thi journei i contempl with great pleasur the fruit of that vallei and the pleasant of the situat the secur from storm on that side of the water and the wood and conclud that i had pitch upon a place to fix my abod which wa by far the worst part of the countri upon the whole i began to consid of remov my habit and look out for a place equal safe as where now i wa situat if possibl in that pleasant fruit part of the island thi thought ran long in my head and i wa exceed fond of it for some time the pleasant of the place tempt me but when i came to a nearer view of it i consid that i wa now by the seasid where it wa at least possibl that someth might happen to my advantag and by the same ill fate that brought me hither might bring some other unhappi wretch to the same place and though it wa scarc probabl that ani such thing should ever happen yet to enclos myself among the hill and wood in the centr of the island wa to anticip my bondag and to render such an affair not onli improb but imposs and that therefor i ought not by ani mean to remov howev i wa so enamour of thi place that i spent much of my time there for the whole of the remain part of the month of juli and though upon second thought i resolv not to remov yet i built me a littl kind of a bower and surround it at a distanc with a strong fenc be a doubl hedg as high as i could reach well stake and fill between with brushwood and here i lai veri secur sometim two or three night togeth alwai go over it with a ladder so that i fanci now i had my countri hous and my sea coast hous and thi work took me up to the begin of august i had but newli finish my fenc and began to enjoi my labour when the rain came on and made me stick close to my first habit for though i had made me a tent like the other with a piec of a sail and spread it veri well yet i had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storm nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rain were extraordinari about the begin of august as i said i had finish my bower and began to enjoi myself the rd of august i found the grape i had hung up perfectli dri and inde were excel good raisin of the sun so i began to take them down from the tree and it wa veri happi that i did so for the rain which follow would have spoil them and i had lost the best part of my winter food for i had abov two hundr larg bunch of them no sooner had i taken them all down and carri the most of them home to my cave than it began to rain and from henc which wa the th of august it rain more or less everi dai till the middl of octob and sometim so violent that i could not stir out of my cave for sever dai in thi season i wa much surpris with the increas of my famili i had been concern for the loss of on of my cat who ran awai from me or as i thought had been dead and i heard no more tide of her till to my astonish she came home about the end of august with three kitten thi wa the more strang to me becaus though i had kill a wild cat as i call it with my gun yet i thought it wa quit a differ kind from our european cat but the young cat were the same kind of hous breed as the old on and both my cat be femal i thought it veri strang but from these three cat i afterward came to be so pester with cat that i wa forc to kill them like vermin or wild beast and to drive them from my hous as much as possibl from the th of august to the th incess rain so that i could not stir and wa now veri care not to be much wet in thi confin i began to be straiten for food but ventur out twice i on dai kill a goat and the last dai which wa the th found a veri larg tortois which wa a treat to me and my food wa regul thu i at a bunch of raisin for my breakfast a piec of the goat s flesh or of the turtl for my dinner broil for to my great misfortun i had no vessel to boil or stew anyth and two or three of the turtl s egg for my supper dure thi confin in my cover by the rain i work daili two or three hour at enlarg my cave and by degre work it on toward on side till i came to the outsid of the hill and made a door or wai out which came beyond my fenc or wall and so i came in and out thi wai but i wa not perfectli easi at ly so open for as i had manag myself befor i wa in a perfect enclosur wherea now i thought i lai expos and open for anyth to come in upon me and yet i could not perceiv that there wa ani live thing to fear the biggest creatur that i had yet seen upon the island be a goat sept i wa now come to the unhappi anniversari of my land i cast up the notch on my post and found i had been on shore three hundr and sixti five dai i kept thi dai as a solemn fast set it apart for religi exercis prostrat myself on the ground with the most seriou humili confess my sin to god acknowledg hi righteou judgment upon me and prai to him to have merci on me through jesu christ and not have tast the least refresh for twelv hour even till the go down of the sun i then at a biscuit cake and a bunch of grape and went to bed finish the dai as i began it i had all thi time observ no sabbath dai for as at first i had no sens of religion upon my mind i had after some time omit to distinguish the week by make a longer notch than ordinari for the sabbath dai and so did not realli know what ani of the dai were but now have cast up the dai as abov i found i had been there a year so i divid it into week and set apart everi seventh dai for a sabbath though i found at the end of my account i had lost a dai or two in my reckon a littl after thi my ink began to fail me and so i content myself to us it more sparingli and to write down onli the most remark event of my life without continu a daili memorandum of other thing the raini season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me and i learn to divid them so as to provid for them accordingli but i bought all my experi befor i had it and thi i am go to relat wa on of the most discourag experi that i made i have mention that i had save the few ear of barlei and rice which i had so surprisingli found spring up as i thought of themselv and i believ there were about thirti stalk of rice and about twenti of barlei and now i thought it a proper time to sow it after the rain the sun be in it southern posit go from me accordingli i dug up a piec of ground as well as i could with my wooden spade and divid it into two part i sow my grain but as i wa sow it casual occur to my thought that i would not sow it all at first becaus i did not know when wa the proper time for it so i sow about two third of the seed leav about a hand of each it wa a great comfort to me afterward that i did so for not on grain of what i sow thi time came to anyth for the dry month follow the earth have had no rain after the seed wa sown it had no moistur to assist it growth and never came up at all till the wet season had come again and then it grew as if it had been but newli sown find my first seed did not grow which i easili imagin wa by the drought i sought for a moister piec of ground to make anoth trial in and i dug up a piec of ground near my new bower and sow the rest of my seed in februari a littl befor the vernal equinox and thi have the raini month of march and april to water it sprung up veri pleasantli and yield a veri good crop but have part of the seed left onli and not dare to sow all that i had i had but a small quantiti at last my whole crop not amount to abov half a peck of each kind but by thi experi i wa made master of my busi and knew exactli when the proper season wa to sow and that i might expect two seed time and two harvest everi year while thi corn wa grow i made a littl discoveri which wa of us to me afterward as soon as the rain were over and the weather began to settl which wa about the month of novemb i made a visit up the countri to my bower where though i had not been some month yet i found all thing just as i left them the circl or doubl hedg that i had made wa not onli firm and entir but the stake which i had cut out of some tree that grew thereabout were all shot out and grown with long branch as much as a willow tree usual shoot the first year after lop it head i could not tell what tree to call it that these stake were cut from i wa surpris and yet veri well pleas to see the young tree grow and i prune them and led them up to grow as much alik as i could and it is scarc credibl how beauti a figur thei grew into in three year so that though the hedg made a circl of about twenti five yard in diamet yet the tree for such i might now call them soon cover it and it wa a complet shade suffici to lodg under all the dry season thi made me resolv to cut some more stake and make me a hedg like thi in a semi circl round my wall i mean that of my first dwell which i did and place the tree or stake in a doubl row at about eight yard distanc from my first fenc thei grew present and were at first a fine cover to my habit and afterward serv for a defenc also as i shall observ in it order i found now that the season of the year might gener be divid not into summer and winter as in europ but into the raini season and the dry season which were gener thu the half of februari the whole of march and the half of april raini the sun be then on or near the equinox the half of april the whole of mai june and juli and the half of august dry the sun be then to the north of the line the half of august the whole of septemb and the half of octob raini the sun be then come back the half of octob the whole of novemb decemb and januari and the half of februari dry the sun be then to the south of the line the raini season sometim held longer or shorter as the wind happen to blow but thi wa the gener observ i made after i had found by experi the ill consequ of be abroad in the rain i took care to furnish myself with provis beforehand that i might not be oblig to go out and i sat within door as much as possibl dure the wet month thi time i found much employ and veri suitabl also to the time for i found great occas for mani thing which i had no wai to furnish myself with but by hard labour and constant applic particularli i tri mani wai to make myself a basket but all the twig i could get for the purpos prove so brittl that thei would do noth it prove of excel advantag to me now that when i wa a boi i us to take great delight in stand at a basket maker s in the town where my father live to see them make their wicker ware and be as boi usual ar veri offici to help and a great observ of the manner in which thei work those thing and sometim lend a hand i had by these mean full knowledg of the method of it and i want noth but the materi when it came into my mind that the twig of that tree from whenc i cut my stake that grew might possibl be as tough as the sallow willow and osier in england and i resolv to try accordingli the next dai i went to my countri hous as i call it and cut some of the smaller twig i found them to my purpos as much as i could desir whereupon i came the next time prepar with a hatchet to cut down a quantiti which i soon found for there wa great plenti of them these i set up to dry within my circl or hedg and when thei were fit for us i carri them to my cave and here dure the next season i emploi myself in make as well as i could a great mani basket both to carri earth or to carri or lai up anyth as i had occas and though i did not finish them veri handsom yet i made them suffici servic for my purpos thu afterward i took care never to be without them and as my wicker ware decai i made more especi strong deep basket to place my corn in instead of sack when i should come to have ani quantiti of it have master thi difficulti and emploi a world of time about it i bestir myself to see if possibl how to suppli two want i had no vessel to hold anyth that wa liquid except two runlet which were almost full of rum and some glass bottl some of the common size and other which were case bottl squar for the hold of water spirit c i had not so much as a pot to boil anyth except a great kettl which i save out of the ship and which wa too big for such as i desir it viz to make broth and stew a bit of meat by itself the second thing i fain would have had wa a tobacco pipe but it wa imposs to me to make on howev i found a contriv for that too at last i emploi myself in plant my second row of stake or pile and in thi wicker work all the summer or dry season when anoth busi took me up more time than it could be imagin i could spare chapter viii survei hi posit i mention befor that i had a great mind to see the whole island and that i had travel up the brook and so on to where i built my bower and where i had an open quit to the sea on the other side of the island i now resolv to travel quit across to the sea shore on that side so take my gun a hatchet and my dog and a larger quantiti of powder and shot than usual with two biscuit cake and a great bunch of raisin in my pouch for my store i began my journei when i had pass the vale where my bower stood as abov i came within view of the sea to the west and it be a veri clear dai i fairli descri land whether an island or a contin i could not tell but it lai veri high extend from the w to the w s w at a veri great distanc by my guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenti leagu off i could not tell what part of the world thi might be otherwis than that i knew it must be part of america and as i conclud by all my observ must be near the spanish dominion and perhap wa all inhabit by savag where if i had land i had been in a wors condit than i wa now and therefor i acquiesc in the disposit of provid which i began now to own and to believ order everyth for the best i sai i quiet my mind with thi and left off afflict myself with fruitless wish of be there besid after some thought upon thi affair i consid that if thi land wa the spanish coast i should certainli on time or other see some vessel pass or repass on wai or other but if not then it wa the savag coast between the spanish countri and brazil where ar found the worst of savag for thei ar cannib or men eater and fail not to murder and devour all the human bodi that fall into their hand with these consider i walk veri leisur forward i found that side of the island where i now wa much pleasant than mine the open or savannah field sweet adorn with flower and grass and full of veri fine wood i saw abund of parrot and fain i would have caught on if possibl to have kept it to be tame and taught it to speak to me i did after some painstak catch a young parrot for i knock it down with a stick and have recov it i brought it home but it wa some year befor i could make him speak howev at last i taught him to call me by name veri familiarli but the accid that follow though it be a trifl will be veri divert in it place i wa exceedingli divert with thi journei i found in the low ground hare as i thought them to be and fox but thei differ greatli from all the other kind i had met with nor could i satisfi myself to eat them though i kill sever but i had no need to be ventur for i had no want of food and of that which wa veri good too especi these three sort viz goat pigeon and turtl or tortois which ad to my grape leadenhal market could not have furnish a tabl better than i in proport to the compani and though my case wa deplor enough yet i had great caus for thank that i wa not driven to ani extrem for food but had rather plenti even to dainti i never travel in thi journei abov two mile outright in a dai or thereabout but i took so mani turn and re turn to see what discoveri i could make that i came weari enough to the place where i resolv to sit down all night and then i either repos myself in a tree or surround myself with a row of stake set upright in the ground either from on tree to anoth or so as no wild creatur could come at me without wake me as soon as i came to the sea shore i wa surpris to see that i had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island for here inde the shore wa cover with innumer turtl wherea on the other side i had found but three in a year and a half here wa also an infinit number of fowl of mani kind some which i had seen and some which i had not seen befor and mani of them veri good meat but such as i knew not the name of except those call penguin i could have shot as mani as i pleas but wa veri spare of my powder and shot and therefor had more mind to kill a she goat if i could which i could better feed on and though there were mani goat here more than on my side the island yet it wa with much more difficulti that i could come near them the countri be flat and even and thei saw me much sooner than when i wa on the hill i confess thi side of the countri wa much pleasant than mine but yet i had not the least inclin to remov for as i wa fix in my habit it becam natur to me and i seem all the while i wa here to be as it were upon a journei and from home howev i travel along the shore of the sea toward the east i suppos about twelv mile and then set up a great pole upon the shore for a mark i conclud i would go home again and that the next journei i took should be on the other side of the island east from my dwell and so round till i came to my post again i took anoth wai to come back than that i went think i could easili keep all the island so much in my view that i could not miss find my first dwell by view the countri but i found myself mistaken for be come about two or three mile i found myself descend into a veri larg vallei but so surround with hill and those hill cover with wood that i could not see which wa my wai by ani direct but that of the sun nor even then unless i knew veri well the posit of the sun at that time of the dai it happen to my further misfortun that the weather prove hazi for three or four dai while i wa in the vallei and not be abl to see the sun i wander about veri uncomfort and at last wa oblig to find the seasid look for my post and come back the same wai i went and then by easi journei i turn homeward the weather be exceed hot and my gun ammunit hatchet and other thing veri heavi in thi journei my dog surpris a young kid and seiz upon it and i run in to take hold of it caught it and save it aliv from the dog i had a great mind to bring it home if i could for i had often been muse whether it might not be possibl to get a kid or two and so rais a breed of tame goat which might suppli me when my powder and shot should be all spent i made a collar for thi littl creatur and with a string which i made of some rope yam which i alwai carri about me i led him along though with some difficulti till i came to my bower and there i enclos him and left him for i wa veri impati to be at home from whenc i had been absent abov a month i cannot express what a satisfact it wa to me to come into my old hutch and lie down in my hammock bed thi littl wander journei without settl place of abod had been so unpleas to me that my own hous as i call it to myself wa a perfect settlement to me compar to that and it render everyth about me so comfort that i resolv i would never go a great wai from it again while it should be my lot to stai on the island i repos myself here a week to rest and regal myself after my long journei dure which most of the time wa taken up in the weighti affair of make a cage for my poll who began now to be a mere domest and to be well acquaint with me then i began to think of the poor kid which i had pen in within my littl circl and resolv to go and fetch it home or give it some food accordingli i went and found it where i left it for inde it could not get out but wa almost starv for want of food i went and cut bough of tree and branch of such shrub as i could find and threw it over and have fed it i ti it as i did befor to lead it awai but it wa so tame with be hungri that i had no need to have ti it for it follow me like a dog and as i continu fed it the creatur becam so love so gentl and so fond that it becam from that time on of my domest also and would never leav me afterward the raini season of the autumn equinox wa now come and i kept the th of septemb in the same solemn manner as befor be the anniversari of my land on the island have now been there two year and no more prospect of be deliv than the first dai i came there i spent the whole dai in humbl and thank acknowledg of the mani wonder merci which my solitari condit wa attend with and without which it might have been infinit more miser i gave humbl and hearti thank that god had been pleas to discov to me that it wa possibl i might be more happi in thi solitari condit than i should have been in the liberti of societi and in all the pleasur of the world that he could fulli make up to me the defici of my solitari state and the want of human societi by hi presenc and the commun of hi grace to my soul support comfort and encourag me to depend upon hi provid here and hope for hi etern presenc hereaft it wa now that i began sensibl to feel how much more happi thi life i now led wa with all it miser circumst than the wick curs abomin life i led all the past part of my dai and now i chang both my sorrow and my joi my veri desir alter my affect chang their gust and my delight were perfectli new from what thei were at my first come or inde for the two year past befor as i walk about either on my hunt or for view the countri the anguish of my soul at my condit would break out upon me on a sudden and my veri heart would die within me to think of the wood the mountain the desert i wa in and how i wa a prison lock up with the etern bar and bolt of the ocean in an uninhabit wilder without redempt in the midst of the greatest composur of my mind thi would break out upon me like a storm and make me wring my hand and weep like a child sometim it would take me in the middl of my work and i would immedi sit down and sigh and look upon the ground for an hour or two togeth and thi wa still wors to me for if i could burst out into tear or vent myself by word it would go off and the grief have exhaust itself would abat but now i began to exercis myself with new thought i daili read the word of god and appli all the comfort of it to my present state on morn be veri sad i open the bibl upon these word i will never never leav thee nor forsak thee immedi it occur that these word were to me why els should thei be direct in such a manner just at the moment when i wa mourn over my condit as on forsaken of god and man well then said i if god doe not forsak me of what ill consequ can it be or what matter it though the world should all forsak me see on the other hand if i had all the world and should lose the favour and bless of god there would be no comparison in the loss from thi moment i began to conclud in my mind that it wa possibl for me to be more happi in thi forsaken solitari condit than it wa probabl i should ever have been in ani other particular state in the world and with thi thought i wa go to give thank to god for bring me to thi place i know not what it wa but someth shock my mind at that thought and i durst not speak the word how canst thou becom such a hypocrit said i even audibl to pretend to be thank for a condit which howev thou mayest endeavour to be content with thou wouldst rather prai heartili to be deliv from so i stop there but though i could not sai i thank god for be there yet i sincer gave thank to god for open my ey by whatev afflict provid to see the former condit of my life and to mourn for my wicked and repent i never open the bibl or shut it but my veri soul within me bless god for direct my friend in england without ani order of mine to pack it up among my good and for assist me afterward to save it out of the wreck of the ship thu and in thi disposit of mind i began my third year and though i have not given the reader the troubl of so particular an account of my work thi year as the first yet in gener it mai be observ that i wa veri seldom idl but have regularli divid my time accord to the sever daili employ that were befor me such as first my duti to god and the read the scriptur which i constantli set apart some time for thrice everi dai secondli the go abroad with my gun for food which gener took me up three hour in everi morn when it did not rain thirdli the order cut preserv and cook what i had kill or caught for my suppli these took up great part of the dai also it is to be consid that in the middl of the dai when the sun wa in the zenith the violenc of the heat wa too great to stir out so that about four hour in the even wa all the time i could be suppos to work in with thi except that sometim i chang my hour of hunt and work and went to work in the morn and abroad with my gun in the afternoon to thi short time allow for labour i desir mai be ad the exceed labori of my work the mani hour which for want of tool want of help and want of skill everyth i did took up out of my time for exampl i wa full two and forti dai in make a board for a long shelf which i want in my cave wherea two sawyer with their tool and a saw pit would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a dai my case wa thi it wa to be a larg tree which wa to be cut down becaus my board wa to be a broad on thi tree i wa three dai in cut down and two more cut off the bough and reduc it to a log or piec of timber with inexpress hack and hew i reduc both the side of it into chip till it began to be light enough to move then i turn it and made on side of it smooth and flat as a board from end to end then turn that side downward cut the other side til i brought the plank to be about three inch thick and smooth on both side ani on mai judg the labour of my hand in such a piec of work but labour and patienc carri me through that and mani other thing i onli observ thi in particular to show the reason why so much of my time went awai with so littl work viz that what might be a littl to be done with help and tool wa a vast labour and requir a prodigi time to do alon and by hand but notwithstand thi with patienc and labour i got through everyth that my circumst made necessari to me to do as will appear by what follow i wa now in the month of novemb and decemb expect my crop of barlei and rice the ground i had manur and dug up for them wa not great for as i observ my seed of each wa not abov the quantiti of half a peck for i had lost on whole crop by sow in the dry season but now my crop promis veri well when on a sudden i found i wa in danger of lose it all again by enemi of sever sort which it wa scarc possibl to keep from it as first the goat and wild creatur which i call hare who tast the sweet of the blade lai in it night and dai as soon as it came up and eat it so close that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk thi i saw no remedi for but by make an enclosur about it with a hedg which i did with a great deal of toil and the more becaus it requir speed howev as my arabl land wa but small suit to my crop i got it total well fenc in about three week time and shoot some of the creatur in the daytim i set my dog to guard it in the night ty him up to a stake at the gate where he would stand and bark all night long so in a littl time the enemi forsook the place and the corn grew veri strong and well and began to ripen apac but as the beast ruin me befor while my corn wa in the blade so the bird were as like to ruin me now when it wa in the ear for go along by the place to see how it throve i saw my littl crop surround with fowl of i know not how mani sort who stood as it were watch till i should be gone i immedi let fly among them for i alwai had my gun with me i had no sooner shot but there rose up a littl cloud of fowl which i had not seen at all from among the corn itself thi touch me sensibl for i foresaw that in a few dai thei would devour all my hope that i should be starv and never be abl to rais a crop at all and what to do i could not tell howev i resolv not to lose my corn if possibl though i should watch it night and dai in the first place i went among it to see what damag wa alreadi done and found thei had spoil a good deal of it but that as it wa yet too green for them the loss wa not so great but that the remaind wa like to be a good crop if it could be save i stai by it to load my gun and then come awai i could easili see the thiev sit upon all the tree about me as if thei onli wait till i wa gone awai and the event prove it to be so for as i walk off as if i wa gone i wa no sooner out of their sight than thei drop down on by on into the corn again i wa so provok that i could not have patienc to stai till more came on know that everi grain that thei at now wa as it might be said a peck loaf to me in the consequ but come up to the hedg i fire again and kill three of them thi wa what i wish for so i took them up and serv them as we serv notori thiev in england hang them in chain for a terror to other it is imposs to imagin that thi should have such an effect as it had for the fowl would not onli not come at the corn but in short thei forsook all that part of the island and i could never see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrow hung there thi i wa veri glad of you mai be sure and about the latter end of decemb which wa our second harvest of the year i reap my corn i wa sadli put to it for a scyth or sickl to cut it down and all i could do wa to make on as well as i could out of on of the broadsword or cutlass which i save among the arm out of the ship howev as my first crop wa but small i had no great difficulti to cut it down in short i reap it in my wai for i cut noth off but the ear and carri it awai in a great basket which i had made and so rub it out with my hand and at the end of all my harvest i found that out of my half peck of seed i had near two bushel of rice and about two bushel and a half of barlei that is to sai by my guess for i had no measur at that time howev thi wa a great encourag to me and i foresaw that in time it would pleas god to suppli me with bread and yet here i wa perplex again for i neither knew how to grind or make meal of my corn or inde how to clean it and part it nor if made into meal how to make bread of it and if how to make it yet i knew not how to bake it these thing be ad to my desir of have a good quantiti for store and to secur a constant suppli i resolv not to tast ani of thi crop but to preserv it all for seed against the next season and in the meantim to emploi all my studi and hour of work to accomplish thi great work of provid myself with corn and bread it might be truli said that now i work for my bread i believ few peopl have thought much upon the strang multitud of littl thing necessari in the provid produc cure dress make and finish thi on articl of bread i that wa reduc to a mere state of natur found thi to my daili discourag and wa made more sensibl of it everi hour even after i had got the first hand of seed corn which as i have said came up unexpectedli and inde to a surpris first i had no plough to turn up the earth no spade or shovel to dig it well thi i conquer by make me a wooden spade as i observ befor but thi did my work but in a wooden manner and though it cost me a great mani dai to make it yet for want of iron it not onli wore out soon but made my work the harder and made it be perform much wors howev thi i bore with and wa content to work it out with patienc and bear with the bad of the perform when the corn wa sown i had no harrow but wa forc to go over it myself and drag a great heavi bough of a tree over it to scratch it as it mai be call rather than rake or harrow it when it wa grow and grown i have observ alreadi how mani thing i want to fenc it secur it mow or reap it cure and carri it home thrash part it from the chaff and save it then i want a mill to grind it siev to dress it yeast and salt to make it into bread and an oven to bake it but all these thing i did without as shall be observ and yet the corn wa an inestim comfort and advantag to me too all thi as i said made everyth labori and tediou to me but that there wa no help for neither wa my time so much loss to me becaus as i had divid it a certain part of it wa everi dai appoint to these work and as i had resolv to us none of the corn for bread till i had a greater quantiti by me i had the next six month to appli myself wholli by labour and invent to furnish myself with utensil proper for the perform all the oper necessari for make the corn when i had it fit for my us chapter ix a boat but first i wa to prepar more land for i had now seed enough to sow abov an acr of ground befor i did thi i had a week s work at least to make me a spade which when it wa done wa but a sorri on inde and veri heavi and requir doubl labour to work with it howev i got through that and sow my seed in two larg flat piec of ground as near my hous as i could find them to my mind and fenc them in with a good hedg the stake of which were all cut off that wood which i had set befor and knew it would grow so that in a year s time i knew i should have a quick or live hedg that would want but littl repair thi work did not take me up less than three month becaus a great part of that time wa the wet season when i could not go abroad within door that is when it rain and i could not go out i found employ in the follow occup alwai observ that all the while i wa at work i divert myself with talk to my parrot and teach him to speak and i quickli taught him to know hi own name and at last to speak it out pretti loud poll which wa the first word i ever heard spoken in the island by ani mouth but my own thi therefor wa not my work but an assist to my work for now as i said i had a great employ upon my hand as follow i had long studi to make by some mean or other some earthen vessel which inde i want sore but knew not where to come at them howev consid the heat of the climat i did not doubt but if i could find out ani clai i might make some pot that might be dri in the sun be hard enough and strong enough to bear handl and to hold anyth that wa dry and requir to be kept so and as thi wa necessari in the prepar corn meal c which wa the thing i wa do i resolv to make some as larg as i could and fit onli to stand like jar to hold what should be put into them it would make the reader piti me or rather laugh at me to tell how mani awkward wai i took to rais thi past what odd misshapen ugli thing i made how mani of them fell in and how mani fell out the clai not be stiff enough to bear it own weight how mani crack by the over violent heat of the sun be set out too hastili and how mani fell in piec with onli remov as well befor as after thei were dri and in a word how after have labour hard to find the clai to dig it to temper it to bring it home and work it i could not make abov two larg earthen ugli thing i cannot call them jar in about two month labour howev as the sun bake these two veri dry and hard i lift them veri gentli up and set them down again in two great wicker basket which i had made on purpos for them that thei might not break and as between the pot and the basket there wa a littl room to spare i stuf it full of the rice and barlei straw and these two pot be to stand alwai dry i thought would hold my dry corn and perhap the meal when the corn wa bruis though i miscarri so much in my design for larg pot yet i made sever smaller thing with better success such as littl round pot flat dish pitcher and pipkin and ani thing my hand turn to and the heat of the sun bake them quit hard but all thi would not answer my end which wa to get an earthen pot to hold what wa liquid and bear the fire which none of these could do it happen after some time make a pretti larg fire for cook my meat when i went to put it out after i had done with it i found a broken piec of on of my earthenwar vessel in the fire burnt as hard as a stone and red as a tile i wa agreeabl surpris to see it and said to myself that certainli thei might be made to burn whole if thei would burn broken thi set me to studi how to order my fire so as to make it burn some pot i had no notion of a kiln such as the potter burn in or of glaze them with lead though i had some lead to do it with but i place three larg pipkin and two or three pot in a pile on upon anoth and place my firewood all round it with a great heap of ember under them i pli the fire with fresh fuel round the outsid and upon the top till i saw the pot in the insid red hot quit through and observ that thei did not crack at all when i saw them clear red i let them stand in that heat about five or six hour till i found on of them though it did not crack did melt or run for the sand which wa mix with the clai melt by the violenc of the heat and would have run into glass if i had gone on so i slack my fire gradual till the pot began to abat of the red colour and watch them all night that i might not let the fire abat too fast in the morn i had three veri good i will not sai handsom pipkin and two other earthen pot as hard burnt as could be desir and on of them perfectli glaze with the run of the sand after thi experi i need not sai that i want no sort of earthenwar for my us but i must need sai as to the shape of them thei were veri indiffer as ani on mai suppos when i had no wai of make them but as the children make dirt pi or as a woman would make pi that never learn to rais past no joi at a thing of so mean a natur wa ever equal to mine when i found i had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire and i had hardli patienc to stai till thei were cold befor i set on on the fire again with some water in it to boil me some meat which it did admir well and with a piec of a kid i made some veri good broth though i want oatmeal and sever other ingredi requisit to make it as good as i would have had it been my next concern wa to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn in for as to the mill there wa no thought of arriv at that perfect of art with on pair of hand to suppli thi want i wa at a great loss for of all the trade in the world i wa as perfectli unqualifi for a stone cutter as for ani whatev neither had i ani tool to go about it with i spent mani a dai to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar and could find none at all except what wa in the solid rock and which i had no wai to dig or cut out nor inde were the rock in the island of hard suffici but were all of a sandi crumbl stone which neither would bear the weight of a heavi pestl nor would break the corn without fill it with sand so after a great deal of time lost in search for a stone i gave it over and resolv to look out for a great block of hard wood which i found inde much easier and get on as big as i had strength to stir i round it and form it on the outsid with my ax and hatchet and then with the help of fire and infinit labour made a hollow place in it as the indian in brazil make their cano after thi i made a great heavi pestl or beater of the wood call the iron wood and thi i prepar and laid by against i had my next crop of corn which i propos to myself to grind or rather pound into meal to make bread my next difficulti wa to make a siev or searc to dress my meal and to part it from the bran and the husk without which i did not see it possibl i could have ani bread thi wa a most difficult thing even to think on for to be sure i had noth like the necessari thing to make it i mean fine thin canva or stuff to searc the meal through and here i wa at a full stop for mani month nor did i realli know what to do linen i had none left but what wa mere rag i had goat s hair but neither knew how to weav it or spin it and had i known how here were no tool to work it with all the remedi that i found for thi wa that at last i did rememb i had among the seamen s cloth which were save out of the ship some neckcloth of calico or muslin and with some piec of these i made three small siev proper enough for the work and thu i made shift for some year how i did afterward i shall show in it place the bake part wa the next thing to be consid and how i should make bread when i came to have corn for first i had no yeast as to that part there wa no suppli the want so i did not concern myself much about it but for an oven i wa inde in great pain at length i found out an experi for that also which wa thi i made some earthen vessel veri broad but not deep that is to sai about two feet diamet and not abov nine inch deep these i burn in the fire as i had done the other and laid them by and when i want to bake i made a great fire upon my hearth which i had pave with some squar tile of my own bake and burn also but i should not call them squar when the firewood wa burn pretti much into ember or live coal i drew them forward upon thi hearth so as to cover it all over and there i let them lie till the hearth wa veri hot then sweep awai all the ember i set down my loaf or loav and whelm down the earthen pot upon them drew the ember all round the outsid of the pot to keep in and add to the heat and thu as well as in the best oven in the world i bake my barlei loav and becam in littl time a good pastrycook into the bargain for i made myself sever cake and pud of the rice but i made no pi neither had i anyth to put into them suppos i had except the flesh either of fowl or goat it need not be wonder at if all these thing took me up most part of the third year of my abod here for it is to be observ that in the interv of these thing i had my new harvest and husbandri to manag for i reap my corn in it season and carri it home as well as i could and laid it up in the ear in my larg basket till i had time to rub it out for i had no floor to thrash it on or instrument to thrash it with and now inde my stock of corn increas i realli want to build my barn bigger i want a place to lai it up in for the increas of the corn now yield me so much that i had of the barlei about twenti bushel and of the rice as much or more insomuch that now i resolv to begin to us it freeli for my bread had been quit gone a great while also i resolv to see what quantiti would be suffici for me a whole year and to sow but onc a year upon the whole i found that the forti bushel of barlei and rice were much more than i could consum in a year so i resolv to sow just the same quantiti everi year that i sow the last in hope that such a quantiti would fulli provid me with bread c all the while these thing were do you mai be sure my thought ran mani time upon the prospect of land which i had seen from the other side of the island and i wa not without secret wish that i were on shore there fanci that see the mainland and an inhabit countri i might find some wai or other to convei myself further and perhap at last find some mean of escap but all thi while i made no allow for the danger of such an undertak and how i might fall into the hand of savag and perhap such as i might have reason to think far wors than the lion and tiger of africa that if i onc came in their power i should run a hazard of more than a thousand to on of be kill and perhap of be eaten for i had heard that the peopl of the caribbean coast were cannib or man eater and i knew by the latitud that i could not be far from that shore then suppos thei were not cannib yet thei might kill me as mani european who had fallen into their hand had been serv even when thei had been ten or twenti togeth much more i that wa but on and could make littl or no defenc all these thing i sai which i ought to have consid well and did come into my thought afterward yet gave me no apprehens at first and my head ran mightili upon the thought of get over to the shore now i wish for my boi xuri and the long boat with shoulder of mutton sail with which i sail abov a thousand mile on the coast of africa but thi wa in vain then i thought i would go and look at our ship s boat which as i have said wa blown up upon the shore a great wai in the storm when we were first cast awai she lai almost where she did at first but not quit and wa turn by the forc of the wave and the wind almost bottom upward against a high ridg of beachi rough sand but no water about her if i had had hand to have refit her and to have launch her into the water the boat would have done well enough and i might have gone back into the brazil with her easili enough but i might have foreseen that i could no more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom than i could remov the island howev i went to the wood and cut lever and roller and brought them to the boat resolv to try what i could do suggest to myself that if i could but turn her down i might repair the damag she had receiv and she would be a veri good boat and i might go to sea in her veri easili i spare no pain inde in thi piec of fruitless toil and spent i think three or four week about it at last find it imposs to heav it up with my littl strength i fell to dig awai the sand to undermin it and so to make it fall down set piec of wood to thrust and guid it right in the fall but when i had done thi i wa unabl to stir it up again or to get under it much less to move it forward toward the water so i wa forc to give it over and yet though i gave over the hope of the boat my desir to ventur over for the main increas rather than decreas as the mean for it seem imposs thi at length put me upon think whether it wa not possibl to make myself a cano or periagua such as the nativ of those climat make even without tool or as i might sai without hand of the trunk of a great tree thi i not onli thought possibl but easi and pleas myself extrem with the thought of make it and with my have much more conveni for it than ani of the negro or indian but not at all consid the particular inconveni which i lai under more than the indian did viz want of hand to move it when it wa made into the water a difficulti much harder for me to surmount than all the consequ of want of tool could be to them for what wa it to me if when i had chosen a vast tree in the wood and with much troubl cut it down if i had been abl with my tool to hew and dub the outsid into the proper shape of a boat and burn or cut out the insid to make it hollow so as to make a boat of it if after all thi i must leav it just there where i found it and not be abl to launch it into the water on would have thought i could not have had the least reflect upon my mind of my circumst while i wa make thi boat but i should have immedi thought how i should get it into the sea but my thought were so intent upon my voyag over the sea in it that i never onc consid how i should get it off the land and it wa realli in it own natur more easi for me to guid it over forti five mile of sea than about forti five fathom of land where it lai to set it afloat in the water i went to work upon thi boat the most like a fool that ever man did who had ani of hi sens awak i pleas myself with the design without determin whether i wa ever abl to undertak it not but that the difficulti of launch my boat came often into my head but i put a stop to my inquiri into it by thi foolish answer which i gave myself let me first make it i warrant i will find some wai or other to get it along when it is done thi wa a most preposter method but the eager of my fanci prevail and to work i went i fell a cedar tree and i question much whether solomon ever had such a on for the build of the templ of jerusalem it wa five feet ten inch diamet at the lower part next the stump and four feet eleven inch diamet at the end of twenti two feet after which it lessen for a while and then part into branch it wa not without infinit labour that i fell thi tree i wa twenti dai hack and hew at it at the bottom i wa fourteen more get the branch and limb and the vast spread head cut off which i hack and hew through with ax and hatchet and inexpress labour after thi it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proport and to someth like the bottom of a boat that it might swim upright as it ought to do it cost me near three month more to clear the insid and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it thi i did inde without fire by mere mallet and chisel and by the dint of hard labour till i had brought it to be a veri handsom periagua and big enough to have carri six and twenti men and consequ big enough to have carri me and all my cargo when i had gone through thi work i wa extrem delight with it the boat wa realli much bigger than ever i saw a cano or periagua that wa made of on tree in my life mani a weari stroke it had cost you mai be sure and had i gotten it into the water i make no question but i should have begun the maddest voyag and the most unlik to be perform that ever wa undertaken but all my devic to get it into the water fail me though thei cost me infinit labour too it lai about on hundr yard from the water and not more but the first inconveni wa it wa up hill toward the creek well to take awai thi discourag i resolv to dig into the surfac of the earth and so make a decliv thi i began and it cost me a prodigi deal of pain but who grudg pain who have their deliver in view but when thi wa work through and thi difficulti manag it wa still much the same for i could no more stir the cano than i could the other boat then i measur the distanc of ground and resolv to cut a dock or canal to bring the water up to the cano see i could not bring the cano down to the water well i began thi work and when i began to enter upon it and calcul how deep it wa to be dug how broad how the stuff wa to be thrown out i found that by the number of hand i had be none but my own it must have been ten or twelv year befor i could have gone through with it for the shore lai so high that at the upper end it must have been at least twenti feet deep so at length though with great reluct i gave thi attempt over also thi griev me heartili and now i saw though too late the folli of begin a work befor we count the cost and befor we judg rightli of our own strength to go through with it in the middl of thi work i finish my fourth year in thi place and kept my anniversari with the same devot and with as much comfort as ever befor for by a constant studi and seriou applic to the word of god and by the assist of hi grace i gain a differ knowledg from what i had befor i entertain differ notion of thing i look now upon the world as a thing remot which i had noth to do with no expect from and inde no desir about in a word i had noth inde to do with it nor wa ever like to have so i thought it look as we mai perhap look upon it hereaft viz as a place i had live in but wa come out of it and well might i sai as father abraham to dive between me and thee is a great gulf fix in the first place i wa remov from all the wicked of the world here i had neither the lust of the flesh the lust of the ey nor the pride of life i had noth to covet for i had all that i wa now capabl of enjoi i wa lord of the whole manor or if i pleas i might call myself king or emperor over the whole countri which i had possess of there were no rival i had no competitor none to disput sovereignti or command with me i might have rais ship load of corn but i had no us for it so i let as littl grow as i thought enough for my occas i had tortois or turtl enough but now and then on wa as much as i could put to ani us i had timber enough to have built a fleet of ship and i had grape enough to have made wine or to have cure into raisin to have load that fleet when it had been built but all i could make us of wa all that wa valuabl i had enough to eat and suppli my want and what wa all the rest to me if i kill more flesh than i could eat the dog must eat it or vermin if i sow more corn than i could eat it must be spoil the tree that i cut down were ly to rot on the ground i could make no more us of them but for fuel and that i had no occas for but to dress my food in a word the natur and experi of thing dictat to me upon just reflect that all the good thing of thi world ar no farther good to us than thei ar for our us and that whatev we mai heap up to give other we enjoi just as much as we can us and no more the most covet gripe miser in the world would have been cure of the vice of covet if he had been in my case for i possess infinit more than i knew what to do with i had no room for desir except it wa of thing which i had not and thei were but trifl though inde of great us to me i had as i hint befor a parcel of monei as well gold as silver about thirti six pound sterl ala there the sorri useless stuff lai i had no more manner of busi for it and often thought with myself that i would have given a hand of it for a gross of tobacco pipe or for a hand mill to grind my corn nai i would have given it all for a sixpenni worth of turnip and carrot seed out of england or for a hand of pea and bean and a bottl of ink as it wa i had not the least advantag by it or benefit from it but there it lai in a drawer and grew mouldi with the damp of the cave in the wet season and if i had had the drawer full of diamond it had been the same case thei had been of no manner of valu to me becaus of no us i had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself than it wa at first and much easier to my mind as well as to my bodi i frequent sat down to meat with thank and admir the hand of god s provid which had thu spread my tabl in the wilder i learn to look more upon the bright side of my condit and less upon the dark side and to consid what i enjoi rather than what i want and thi gave me sometim such secret comfort that i cannot express them and which i take notic of here to put those discont peopl in mind of it who cannot enjoi comfort what god ha given them becaus thei see and covet someth that he ha not given them all our discont about what we want appear to me to spring from the want of thank for what we have anoth reflect wa of great us to me and doubtless would be so to ani on that should fall into such distress as mine wa and thi wa to compar my present condit with what i at first expect it would be nai with what it would certainli have been if the good provid of god had not wonderfulli order the ship to be cast up nearer to the shore where i not onli could come at her but could bring what i got out of her to the shore for my relief and comfort without which i had want for tool to work weapon for defenc and gunpowd and shot for get my food i spent whole hour i mai sai whole dai in repres to myself in the most live colour how i must have act if i had got noth out of the ship how i could not have so much as got ani food except fish and turtl and that as it wa long befor i found ani of them i must have perish first that i should have live if i had not perish like a mere savag that if i had kill a goat or a fowl by ani contriv i had no wai to flai or open it or part the flesh from the skin and the bowel or to cut it up but must gnaw it with my teeth and pull it with my claw like a beast these reflect made me veri sensibl of the good of provid to me and veri thank for my present condit with all it hardship and misfortun and thi part also i cannot but recommend to the reflect of those who ar apt in their miseri to sai is ani afflict like mine let them consid how much wors the case of some peopl ar and their case might have been if provid had thought fit i had anoth reflect which assist me also to comfort my mind with hope and thi wa compar my present situat with what i had deserv and had therefor reason to expect from the hand of provid i had live a dread life perfectli destitut of the knowledg and fear of god i had been well instruct by father and mother neither had thei been want to me in their earli endeavour to infus a religi aw of god into my mind a sens of my duti and what the natur and end of my be requir of me but ala fall earli into the seafar life which of all live is the most destitut of the fear of god though hi terror ar alwai befor them i sai fall earli into the seafar life and into seafar compani all that littl sens of religion which i had entertain wa laugh out of me by my messmat by a harden despis of danger and the view of death which grew habitu to me by my long absenc from all manner of opportun to convers with anyth but what wa like myself or to hear anyth that wa good or tend toward it so void wa i of everyth that wa good or the least sens of what i wa or wa to be that in the greatest deliver i enjoi such as my escap from salle my be taken up by the portugues master of the ship my be plant so well in the brazil my receiv the cargo from england and the like i never had onc the word thank god so much as on my mind or in my mouth nor in the greatest distress had i so much as a thought to prai to him or so much as to sai lord have merci upon me no nor to mention the name of god unless it wa to swear by and blasphem it i had terribl reflect upon my mind for mani month as i have alreadi observ on account of my wick and harden life past and when i look about me and consid what particular provid had attend me sinc my come into thi place and how god had dealt bountifulli with me had not onli punish me less than my iniqu had deserv but had so plentifulli provid for me thi gave me great hope that my repent wa accept and that god had yet merci in store for me with these reflect i work my mind up not onli to a resign to the will of god in the present disposit of my circumst but even to a sincer thank for my condit and that i who wa yet a live man ought not to complain see i had not the due punish of my sin that i enjoi so mani merci which i had no reason to have expect in that place that i ought never more to repin at my condit but to rejoic and to give daili thank for that daili bread which noth but a crowd of wonder could have brought that i ought to consid i had been fed even by a miracl even as great as that of feed elijah by raven nai by a long seri of miracl and that i could hardli have name a place in the uninhabit part of the world where i could have been cast more to my advantag a place where as i had no societi which wa my afflict on on hand so i found no raven beast no furiou wolv or tiger to threaten my life no venom creatur or poison which i might feed on to my hurt no savag to murder and devour me in a word as my life wa a life of sorrow on wai so it wa a life of merci anoth and i want noth to make it a life of comfort but to be abl to make my sens of god s good to me and care over me in thi condit be my daili consol and after i did make a just improv on these thing i went awai and wa no more sad i had now been here so long that mani thing which i had brought on shore for my help were either quit gone or veri much wast and near spent my ink as i observ had been gone some time all but a veri littl which i ek out with water a littl and a littl till it wa so pale it scarc left ani appear of black upon the paper as long as it last i made us of it to minut down the dai of the month on which ani remark thing happen to me and first by cast up time past i rememb that there wa a strang concurr of dai in the variou provid which befel me and which if i had been superstiti inclin to observ dai as fatal or fortun i might have had reason to have look upon with a great deal of curios first i had observ that the same dai that i broke awai from my father and friend and ran awai to hull in order to go to sea the same dai afterward i wa taken by the salle man of war and made a slave the same dai of the year that i escap out of the wreck of that ship in yarmouth road that same dai year afterward i made my escap from salle in a boat the same dai of the year i wa born on viz the th of septemb that same dai i had my life so miracul save twenti six year after when i wa cast on shore in thi island so that my wick life and my solitari life began both on a dai the next thing to my ink be wast wa that of my bread i mean the biscuit which i brought out of the ship thi i had husband to the last degre allow myself but on cake of bread a dai for abov a year and yet i wa quit without bread for near a year befor i got ani corn of my own and great reason i had to be thank that i had ani at all the get it be as ha been alreadi observ next to miracul my cloth too began to decai as to linen i had had none a good while except some chequer shirt which i found in the chest of the other seamen and which i carefulli preserv becaus mani time i could bear no other cloth on but a shirt and it wa a veri great help to me that i had among all the men s cloth of the ship almost three dozen of shirt there were also inde sever thick watch coat of the seamen s which were left but thei were too hot to wear and though it is true that the weather wa so violent hot that there wa no need of cloth yet i could not go quit nake no though i had been inclin to it which i wa not nor could i abid the thought of it though i wa alon the reason why i could not go nake wa i could not bear the heat of the sun so well when quit nake as with some cloth on nai the veri heat frequent blister my skin wherea with a shirt on the air itself made some motion and whistl under the shirt wa twofold cooler than without it no more could i ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat the heat of the sun beat with such violenc as it doe in that place would give me the headach present by dart so directli on my head without a cap or hat on so that i could not bear it wherea if i put on my hat it would present go awai upon these view i began to consid about put the few rag i had which i call cloth into some order i had worn out all the waistcoat i had and my busi wa now to try if i could not make jacket out of the great watch coat which i had by me and with such other materi as i had so i set to work tailor or rather inde botch for i made most piteou work of it howev i made shift to make two or three new waistcoat which i hope would serv me a great while as for breech or drawer i made but a veri sorri shift inde till afterward i have mention that i save the skin of all the creatur that i kill i mean four foot on and i had them hung up stretch out with stick in the sun by which mean some of them were so dry and hard that thei were fit for littl but other were veri us the first thing i made of these wa a great cap for my head with the hair on the outsid to shoot off the rain and thi i perform so well that after i made me a suit of cloth wholli of these skin that is to sai a waistcoat and breech open at the knee and both loos for thei were rather want to keep me cool than to keep me warm i must not omit to acknowledg that thei were wretchedli made for if i wa a bad carpent i wa a wors tailor howev thei were such as i made veri good shift with and when i wa out if it happen to rain the hair of my waistcoat and cap be outermost i wa kept veri dry after thi i spent a great deal of time and pain to make an umbrella i wa inde in great want of on and had a great mind to make on i had seen them made in the brazil where thei ar veri us in the great heat there and i felt the heat everi jot as great here and greater too be nearer the equinox besid as i wa oblig to be much abroad it wa a most us thing to me as well for the rain as the heat i took a world of pain with it and wa a great while befor i could make anyth like to hold nai after i had thought i had hit the wai i spoil two or three befor i made on to my mind but at last i made on that answer indiffer well the main difficulti i found wa to make it let down i could make it spread but if it did not let down too and draw in it wa not portabl for me ani wai but just over my head which would not do howev at last as i said i made on to answer and cover it with skin the hair upward so that it cast off the rain like a pent hous and kept off the sun so effectu that i could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantag than i could befor in the coolest and when i had no need of it could close it and carri it under my arm thu i live mighti comfort my mind be entir compos by resign myself to the will of god and throw myself wholli upon the dispos of hi provid thi made my life better than sociabl for when i began to regret the want of convers i would ask myself whether thu convers mutual with my own thought and as i hope i mai sai with even god himself by ejacul wa not better than the utmost enjoy of human societi in the world chapter x tame goat i cannot sai that after thi for five year ani extraordinari thing happen to me but i live on in the same cours in the same postur and place as befor the chief thing i wa emploi in besid my yearli labour of plant my barlei and rice and cure my raisin of both which i alwai kept up just enough to have suffici stock of on year s provis beforehand i sai besid thi yearli labour and my daili pursuit of go out with my gun i had on labour to make a cano which at last i finish so that by dig a canal to it of six feet wide and four feet deep i brought it into the creek almost half a mile as for the first which wa so vastli big for i made it without consid beforehand as i ought to have done how i should be abl to launch it so never be abl to bring it into the water or bring the water to it i wa oblig to let it lie where it wa as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser the next time inde the next time though i could not get a tree proper for it and wa in a place where i could not get the water to it at ani less distanc than as i have said near half a mile yet as i saw it wa practic at last i never gave it over and though i wa near two year about it yet i never grudg my labour in hope of have a boat to go off to sea at last howev though my littl periagua wa finish yet the size of it wa not at all answer to the design which i had in view when i made the first i mean of ventur over to the terra firma where it wa abov forti mile broad accordingli the small of my boat assist to put an end to that design and now i thought no more of it as i had a boat my next design wa to make a cruis round the island for as i had been on the other side in on place cross as i have alreadi describ it over the land so the discoveri i made in that littl journei made me veri eager to see other part of the coast and now i had a boat i thought of noth but sail round the island for thi purpos that i might do everyth with discret and consider i fit up a littl mast in my boat and made a sail too out of some of the piec of the ship s sail which lai in store and of which i had a great stock by me have fit my mast and sail and tri the boat i found she would sail veri well then i made littl locker or box at each end of my boat to put provis necessari ammunit c into to be kept dry either from rain or the sprai of the sea and a littl long hollow place i cut in the insid of the boat where i could lai my gun make a flap to hang down over it to keep it dry i fix my umbrella also in the step at the stern like a mast to stand over my head and keep the heat of the sun off me like an awn and thu i everi now and then took a littl voyag upon the sea but never went far out nor far from the littl creek at last be eager to view the circumfer of my littl kingdom i resolv upon my cruis and accordingli i victual my ship for the voyag put in two dozen of loav cake i should call them of barlei bread an earthen pot full of parch rice a food i at a good deal of a littl bottl of rum half a goat and powder and shot for kill more and two larg watch coat of those which as i mention befor i had save out of the seamen s chest these i took on to lie upon and the other to cover me in the night it wa the th of novemb in the sixth year of my reign or my captiv which you pleas that i set out on thi voyag and i found it much longer than i expect for though the island itself wa not veri larg yet when i came to the east side of it i found a great ledg of rock lie out about two leagu into the sea some abov water some under it and beyond that a shoal of sand ly dry half a leagu more so that i wa oblig to go a great wai out to sea to doubl the point when i first discov them i wa go to give over my enterpris and come back again not know how far it might oblig me to go out to sea and abov all doubt how i should get back again so i came to an anchor for i had made a kind of an anchor with a piec of a broken grappl which i got out of the ship have secur my boat i took my gun and went on shore climb up a hill which seem to overlook that point where i saw the full extent of it and resolv to ventur in my view the sea from that hill where i stood i perceiv a strong and inde a most furiou current which ran to the east and even came close to the point and i took the more notic of it becaus i saw there might be some danger that when i came into it i might be carri out to sea by the strength of it and not be abl to make the island again and inde had i not got first upon thi hill i believ it would have been so for there wa the same current on the other side the island onli that it set off at a further distanc and i saw there wa a strong eddi under the shore so i had noth to do but to get out of the first current and i should present be in an eddi i lai here howev two dai becaus the wind blow pretti fresh at es and that be just contrari to the current made a great breach of the sea upon the point so that it wa not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the breach nor to go too far off becaus of the stream the third dai in the morn the wind have abat overnight the sea wa calm and i ventur but i am a warn to all rash and ignor pilot for no sooner wa i come to the point when i wa not even my boat s length from the shore but i found myself in a great depth of water and a current like the sluic of a mill it carri my boat along with it with such violenc that all i could do could not keep her so much as on the edg of it but i found it hurri me farther and farther out from the eddi which wa on my left hand there wa no wind stir to help me and all i could do with my paddl signifi noth and now i began to give myself over for lost for as the current wa on both side of the island i knew in a few leagu distanc thei must join again and then i wa irrecover gone nor did i see ani possibl of avoid it so that i had no prospect befor me but of perish not by the sea for that wa calm enough but of starv from hunger i had inde found a tortois on the shore as big almost as i could lift and had toss it into the boat and i had a great jar of fresh water that is to sai on of my earthen pot but what wa all thi to be driven into the vast ocean where to be sure there wa no shore no mainland or island for a thousand leagu at least and now i saw how easi it wa for the provid of god to make even the most miser condit of mankind wors now i look back upon my desol solitari island as the most pleasant place in the world and all the happi my heart could wish for wa to be but there again i stretch out my hand to it with eager wish o happi desert said i i shall never see thee more o miser creatur whither am go then i reproach myself with my unthank temper and that i had repin at my solitari condit and now what would i give to be on shore there again thu we never see the true state of our condit till it is illustr to us by it contrari nor know how to valu what we enjoi but by the want of it it is scarc possibl to imagin the constern i wa now in be driven from my belov island for so it appear to me now to be into the wide ocean almost two leagu and in the utmost despair of ever recov it again howev i work hard till inde my strength wa almost exhaust and kept my boat as much to the northward that is toward the side of the current which the eddi lai on as possibl i could when about noon as the sun pass the meridian i thought i felt a littl breez of wind in my face spring up from sse thi cheer my heart a littl and especi when in about half an hour more it blew a pretti gentl gale by thi time i had got at a fright distanc from the island and had the least cloudi or hazi weather interven i had been undon anoth wai too for i had no compass on board and should never have known how to have steer toward the island if i had but onc lost sight of it but the weather continu clear i appli myself to get up my mast again and spread my sail stand awai to the north as much as possibl to get out of the current just as i had set my mast and sail and the boat began to stretch awai i saw even by the clear of the water some alter of the current wa near for where the current wa so strong the water wa foul but perceiv the water clear i found the current abat and present i found to the east at about half a mile a breach of the sea upon some rock these rock i found caus the current to part again and as the main stress of it ran awai more southerli leav the rock to the north east so the other return by the repuls of the rock and made a strong eddi which ran back again to the north west with a veri sharp stream thei who know what it is to have a repriev brought to them upon the ladder or to be rescu from thiev just go to murder them or who have been in such extrem mai guess what my present surpris of joi wa and how gladli i put my boat into the stream of thi eddi and the wind also freshen how gladli i spread my sail to it run cheerfulli befor the wind and with a strong tide or eddi underfoot thi eddi carri me about a leagu on my wai back again directli toward the island but about two leagu more to the northward than the current which carri me awai at first so that when i came near the island i found myself open to the northern shore of it that is to sai the other end of the island opposit to that which i went out from when i had made someth more than a leagu of wai by the help of thi current or eddi i found it wa spent and serv me no further howev i found that be between two great current viz that on the south side which had hurri me awai and that on the north which lai about a leagu on the other side i sai between these two in the wake of the island i found the water at least still and run no wai and have still a breez of wind fair for me i kept on steer directli for the island though not make such fresh wai as i did befor about four o clock in the even be then within a leagu of the island i found the point of the rock which occas thi disast stretch out as is describ befor to the southward and cast off the current more southerli had of cours made anoth eddi to the north and thi i found veri strong but not directli set the wai my cours lai which wa due west but almost full north howev have a fresh gale i stretch across thi eddi slant north west and in about an hour came within about a mile of the shore where it be smooth water i soon got to land when i wa on shore god i fell on my knee and gave god thank for my deliver resolv to lai asid all thought of my deliver by my boat and refresh myself with such thing as i had i brought my boat close to the shore in a littl cove that i had spi under some tree and laid me down to sleep be quit spent with the labour and fatigu of the voyag i wa now at a great loss which wai to get home with my boat i had run so much hazard and knew too much of the case to think of attempt it by the wai i went out and what might be at the other side i mean the west side i knew not nor had i ani mind to run ani more ventur so i resolv on the next morn to make my wai westward along the shore and to see if there wa no creek where i might lai up my frigat in safeti so as to have her again if i want her in about three mile or thereabout coast the shore i came to a veri good inlet or bai about a mile over which narrow till it came to a veri littl rivulet or brook where i found a veri conveni harbour for my boat and where she lai as if she had been in a littl dock made on purpos for her here i put in and have stow my boat veri safe i went on shore to look about me and see where i wa i soon found i had but a littl pass by the place where i had been befor when i travel on foot to that shore so take noth out of my boat but my gun and umbrella for it wa exceedingli hot i began my march the wai wa comfort enough after such a voyag as i had been upon and i reach my old bower in the even where i found everyth stand as i left it for i alwai kept it in good order be as i said befor my countri hous i got over the fenc and laid me down in the shade to rest my limb for i wa veri weari and fell asleep but judg you if you can that read my stori what a surpris i must be in when i wa awak out of my sleep by a voic call me by my name sever time robin robin robin cruso poor robin cruso where ar you robin cruso where ar you where have you been i wa so dead asleep at first be fatigu with row or part of the dai and with walk the latter part that i did not wake thoroughli but doze thought i dream that somebodi spoke to me but as the voic continu to repeat robin cruso robin cruso at last i began to wake more perfectli and wa at first dreadfulli frighten and start up in the utmost constern but no sooner were my ey open but i saw my poll sit on the top of the hedg and immedi knew that it wa he that spoke to me for just in such bemoan languag i had us to talk to him and teach him and he had learn it so perfectli that he would sit upon my finger and lai hi bill close to my face and cry poor robin cruso where ar you where have you been how came you here and such thing as i had taught him howev even though i knew it wa the parrot and that inde it could be nobodi els it wa a good while befor i could compos myself first i wa amaz how the creatur got thither and then how he should just keep about the place and nowher els but as i wa well satisfi it could be nobodi but honest poll i got over it and hold out my hand and call him by hi name poll the sociabl creatur came to me and sat upon my thumb as he us to do and continu talk to me poor robin cruso and how did i come here and where had i been just as if he had been overjoi to see me again and so i carri him home along with me i had now had enough of rambl to sea for some time and had enough to do for mani dai to sit still and reflect upon the danger i had been in i would have been veri glad to have had my boat again on my side of the island but i knew not how it wa practic to get it about as to the east side of the island which i had gone round i knew well enough there wa no ventur that wai my veri heart would shrink and my veri blood run chill but to think of it and as to the other side of the island i did not know how it might be there but suppos the current ran with the same forc against the shore at the east as it pass by it on the other i might run the same risk of be driven down the stream and carri by the island as i had been befor of be carri awai from it so with these thought i content myself to be without ani boat though it had been the product of so mani month labour to make it and of so mani more to get it into the sea in thi govern of my temper i remain near a year and live a veri sedat retir life as you mai well suppos and my thought be veri much compos as to my condit and fulli comfort in resign myself to the disposit of provid i thought i live realli veri happili in all thing except that of societi i improv myself in thi time in all the mechan exercis which my necess put me upon appli myself to and i believ i should upon occas have made a veri good carpent especi consid how few tool i had besid thi i arriv at an unexpect perfect in my earthenwar and contriv well enough to make them with a wheel which i found infinit easier and better becaus i made thing round and shape which befor were filthi thing inde to look on but i think i wa never more vain of my own perform or more joy for anyth i found out than for my be abl to make a tobacco pipe and though it wa a veri ugli clumsi thing when it wa done and onli burn red like other earthenwar yet as it wa hard and firm and would draw the smoke i wa exceedingli comfort with it for i had been alwai us to smoke and there were pipe in the ship but i forgot them at first not think there wa tobacco in the island and afterward when i search the ship again i could not come at ani pipe in my wicker ware also i improv much and made abund of necessari basket as well as my invent show me though not veri handsom yet thei were such as were veri handi and conveni for lai thing up in or fetch thing home for exampl if i kill a goat abroad i could hang it up in a tree flai it dress it and cut it in piec and bring it home in a basket and the like by a turtl i could cut it up take out the egg and a piec or two of the flesh which wa enough for me and bring them home in a basket and leav the rest behind me also larg deep basket were the receiv of my corn which i alwai rub out as soon as it wa dry and cure and kept it in great basket i began now to perceiv my powder abat consider thi wa a want which it wa imposs for me to suppli and i began serious to consid what i must do when i should have no more powder that is to sai how i should kill ani goat i had as is observ in the third year of my be here kept a young kid and bred her up tame and i wa in hope of get a he goat but i could not by ani mean bring it to pass till my kid grew an old goat and as i could never find in my heart to kill her she di at last of mere ag but be now in the eleventh year of my resid and as i have said my ammunit grow low i set myself to studi some art to trap and snare the goat to see whether i could not catch some of them aliv and particularli i want a she goat great with young for thi purpos i made snare to hamper them and i do believ thei were more than onc taken in them but my tackl wa not good for i had no wire and i alwai found them broken and my bait devour at length i resolv to try a pitfal so i dug sever larg pit in the earth in place where i had observ the goat us to feed and over those pit i place hurdl of my own make too with a great weight upon them and sever time i put ear of barlei and dry rice without set the trap and i could easili perceiv that the goat had gone in and eaten up the corn for i could see the mark of their feet at length i set three trap in on night and go the next morn i found them all stand and yet the bait eaten and gone thi wa veri discourag howev i alter my trap and not to troubl you with particular go on morn to see my trap i found in on of them a larg old he goat and in on of the other three kid a male and two femal as to the old on i knew not what to do with him he wa so fierc i durst not go into the pit to him that is to sai to bring him awai aliv which wa what i want i could have kill him but that wa not my busi nor would it answer my end so i even let him out and he ran awai as if he had been frighten out of hi wit but i did not then know what i afterward learn that hunger will tame a lion if i had let him stai three or four dai without food and then have carri him some water to drink and then a littl corn he would have been as tame as on of the kid for thei ar mighti sagaci tractabl creatur where thei ar well us howev for the present i let him go know no better at that time then i went to the three kid and take them on by on i ti them with string togeth and with some difficulti brought them all home it wa a good while befor thei would feed but throw them some sweet corn it tempt them and thei began to be tame and now i found that if i expect to suppli myself with goat flesh when i had no powder or shot left breed some up tame wa my onli wai when perhap i might have them about my hous like a flock of sheep but then it occur to me that i must keep the tame from the wild or els thei would alwai run wild when thei grew up and the onli wai for thi wa to have some enclos piec of ground well fenc either with hedg or pale to keep them in so effectu that those within might not break out or those without break in thi wa a great undertak for on pair of hand yet as i saw there wa an absolut necess for do it my first work wa to find out a proper piec of ground where there wa like to be herbag for them to eat water for them to drink and cover to keep them from the sun those who understand such enclosur will think i had veri littl contriv when i pitch upon a place veri proper for all these be a plain open piec of meadow land or savannah as our peopl call it in the western coloni which had two or three littl drill of fresh water in it and at on end wa veri woodi i sai thei will smile at my forecast when i shall tell them i began by enclos thi piec of ground in such a manner that my hedg or pale must have been at least two mile about nor wa the mad of it so great as to the compass for if it wa ten mile about i wa like to have time enough to do it in but i did not consid that my goat would be as wild in so much compass as if thei had had the whole island and i should have so much room to chase them in that i should never catch them my hedg wa begun and carri on i believ about fifti yard when thi thought occur to me so i present stop short and for the begin i resolv to enclos a piec of about on hundr and fifti yard in length and on hundr yard in breadth which as it would maintain as mani as i should have in ani reason time so as my stock increas i could add more ground to my enclosur thi wa act with some prudenc and i went to work with courag i wa about three month hedg in the first piec and till i had done it i tether the three kid in the best part of it and us them to feed as near me as possibl to make them familiar and veri often i would go and carri them some ear of barlei or a hand of rice and feed them out of my hand so that after my enclosur wa finish and i let them loos thei would follow me up and down bleat after me for a hand of corn thi answer my end and in about a year and a half i had a flock of about twelv goat kid and all and in two year more i had three and forti besid sever that i took and kill for my food after that i enclos five sever piec of ground to feed them in with littl pen to drive them to take them as i want and gate out of on piec of ground into anoth but thi wa not all for now i not onli had goat s flesh to feed on when i pleas but milk too a thing which inde in the begin i did not so much as think of and which when it came into my thought wa realli an agreeabl surpris for now i set up my dairi and had sometim a gallon or two of milk in a dai and as natur who give suppli of food to everi creatur dictat even natur how to make us of it so i that had never milk a cow much less a goat or seen butter or chees made onli when i wa a boi after a great mani essai and miscarriag made both butter and chees at last also salt though i found it partli made to my hand by the heat of the sun upon some of the rock of the sea and never want it afterward how mercifulli can our creator treat hi creatur even in those condit in which thei seem to be overwhelm in destruct how can he sweeten the bitterest provid and give us caus to prais him for dungeon and prison what a tabl wa here spread for me in the wilder where i saw noth at first but to perish for hunger chapter xi find print of man s foot on the sand it would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and my littl famili sit down to dinner there wa my majesti the princ and lord of the whole island i had the live of all my subject at my absolut command i could hang draw give liberti and take it awai and no rebel among all my subject then to see how like a king i dine too all alon attend by my servant poll as if he had been my favourit wa the onli person permit to talk to me my dog who wa now grown old and crazi and had found no speci to multipli hi kind upon sat alwai at my right hand and two cat on on on side of the tabl and on on the other expect now and then a bit from my hand as a mark of especi favour but these were not the two cat which i brought on shore at first for thei were both of them dead and had been inter near my habit by my own hand but on of them have multipli by i know not what kind of creatur these were two which i had preserv tame wherea the rest ran wild in the wood and becam inde troublesom to me at last for thei would often come into my hous and plunder me too till at last i wa oblig to shoot them and did kill a great mani at length thei left me with thi attend and in thi plenti manner i live neither could i be said to want anyth but societi and of that some time after thi i wa like to have too much i wa someth impati as i have observ to have the us of my boat though veri loath to run ani more hazard and therefor sometim i sat contriv wai to get her about the island and at other time i sat myself down content enough without her but i had a strang uneasi in my mind to go down to the point of the island where as i have said in my last rambl i went up the hill to see how the shore lai and how the current set that i might see what i had to do thi inclin increas upon me everi dai and at length i resolv to travel thither by land follow the edg of the shore i did so but had ani on in england met such a man as i wa it must either have frighten him or rais a great deal of laughter and as i frequent stood still to look at myself i could not but smile at the notion of my travel through yorkshir with such an equipag and in such a dress be pleas to take a sketch of my figur as follow i had a great high shapeless cap made of a goat s skin with a flap hang down behind as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain off from run into my neck noth be so hurt in these climat as the rain upon the flesh under the cloth i had a short jacket of goat s skin the skirt come down to about the middl of the thigh and a pair of open kneed breech of the same the breech were made of the skin of an old he goat whose hair hung down such a length on either side that like pantaloon it reach to the middl of my leg stock and shoe i had none but had made me a pair of someth i scarc knew what to call them like buskin to flap over my leg and lace on either side like spatterdash but of a most barbar shape as inde were all the rest of my cloth i had on a broad belt of goat s skin dri which i drew togeth with two thong of the same instead of buckl and in a kind of a frog on either side of thi instead of a sword and dagger hung a littl saw and a hatchet on on on side and on on the other i had anoth belt not so broad and fasten in the same manner which hung over my shoulder and at the end of it under my left arm hung two pouch both made of goat s skin too in on of which hung my powder in the other my shot at my back i carri my basket and on my shoulder my gun and over my head a great clumsi ugli goat s skin umbrella but which after all wa the most necessari thing i had about me next to my gun as for my face the colour of it wa realli not so mulatto like as on might expect from a man not at all care of it and live within nine or ten degre of the equinox my beard i had onc suffer to grow till it wa about a quarter of a yard long but as i had both scissor and razor suffici i had cut it pretti short except what grew on my upper lip which i had trim into a larg pair of mahometan whisker such as i had seen worn by some turk at salle for the moor did not wear such though the turk did of these moustachio or whisker i will not sai thei were long enough to hang my hat upon them but thei were of a length and shape monstrou enough and such as in england would have pass for fright but all thi is by the bye for as to my figur i had so few to observ me that it wa of no manner of consequ so i sai no more of that in thi kind of dress i went my new journei and wa out five or six dai i travel first along the sea shore directli to the place where i first brought my boat to an anchor to get upon the rock and have no boat now to take care of i went over the land a nearer wai to the same height that i wa upon befor when look forward to the point of the rock which lai out and which i wa oblig to doubl with my boat as is said abov i wa surpris to see the sea all smooth and quiet no rippl no motion no current ani more there than in other place i wa at a strang loss to understand thi and resolv to spend some time in the observ it to see if noth from the set of the tide had occas it but i wa present convinc how it wa viz that the tide of ebb set from the west and join with the current of water from some great river on the shore must be the occas of thi current and that accord as the wind blew more forcibl from the west or from the north thi current came nearer or went farther from the shore for wait thereabout till even i went up to the rock again and then the tide of ebb be made i plainli saw the current again as befor onli that it ran farther off be near half a leagu from the shore wherea in my case it set close upon the shore and hurri me and my cano along with it which at anoth time it would not have done thi observ convinc me that i had noth to do but to observ the eb and the flow of the tide and i might veri easili bring my boat about the island again but when i began to think of put it in practic i had such terror upon my spirit at the remembr of the danger i had been in that i could not think of it again with ani patienc but on the contrari i took up anoth resolut which wa more safe though more labori and thi wa that i would build or rather make me anoth periagua or cano and so have on for on side of the island and on for the other you ar to understand that now i had as i mai call it two plantat in the island on my littl fortif or tent with the wall about it under the rock with the cave behind me which by thi time i had enlarg into sever apart or cave on within anoth on of these which wa the driest and largest and had a door out beyond my wall or fortif that is to sai beyond where my wall join to the rock wa all fill up with the larg earthen pot of which i have given an account and with fourteen or fifteen great basket which would hold five or six bushel each where i laid up my store of provis especi my corn some in the ear cut off short from the straw and the other rub out with my hand as for my wall made as befor with long stake or pile those pile grew all like tree and were by thi time grown so big and spread so veri much that there wa not the least appear to ani on s view of ani habit behind them near thi dwell of mine but a littl farther within the land and upon lower ground lai my two piec of corn land which i kept duli cultiv and sow and which duli yield me their harvest in it season and whenev i had occas for more corn i had more land adjoin as fit as that besid thi i had my countri seat and i had now a toler plantat there also for first i had my littl bower as i call it which i kept in repair that is to sai i kept the hedg which encircl it in constantli fit up to it usual height the ladder stand alwai in the insid i kept the tree which at first were no more than stake but were now grown veri firm and tall alwai cut so that thei might spread and grow thick and wild and make the more agreeabl shade which thei did effectu to my mind in the middl of thi i had my tent alwai stand be a piec of a sail spread over pole set up for that purpos and which never want ani repair or renew and under thi i had made me a squab or couch with the skin of the creatur i had kill and with other soft thing and a blanket laid on them such as belong to our sea bed which i had save and a great watch coat to cover me and here whenev i had occas to be absent from my chief seat i took up my countri habit adjoin to thi i had my enclosur for my cattl that is to sai my goat and i had taken an inconceiv deal of pain to fenc and enclos thi ground i wa so anxiou to see it kept entir lest the goat should break through that i never left off till with infinit labour i had stuck the outsid of the hedg so full of small stake and so near to on anoth that it wa rather a pale than a hedg and there wa scarc room to put a hand through between them which afterward when those stake grew as thei all did in the next raini season made the enclosur strong like a wall inde stronger than ani wall thi will testifi for me that i wa not idl and that i spare no pain to bring to pass whatev appear necessari for my comfort support for i consid the keep up a breed of tame creatur thu at my hand would be a live magazin of flesh milk butter and chees for me as long as i live in the place if it were to be forti year and that keep them in my reach depend entir upon my perfect my enclosur to such a degre that i might be sure of keep them togeth which by thi method inde i so effectu secur that when these littl stake began to grow i had plant them so veri thick that i wa forc to pull some of them up again in thi place also i had my grape grow which i princip depend on for my winter store of raisin and which i never fail to preserv veri carefulli as the best and most agreeabl dainti of my whole diet and inde thei were not onli agreeabl but medicin wholesom nourish and refresh to the last degre as thi wa also about half wai between my other habit and the place where i had laid up my boat i gener stai and lai here in my wai thither for i us frequent to visit my boat and i kept all thing about or belong to her in veri good order sometim i went out in her to divert myself but no more hazard voyag would i go scarc ever abov a stone s cast or two from the shore i wa so apprehens of be hurri out of my knowledg again by the current or wind or ani other accid but now i come to a new scene of my life it happen on dai about noon go toward my boat i wa exceedingli surpris with the print of a man s nake foot on the shore which wa veri plain to be seen on the sand i stood like on thunderstruck or as if i had seen an apparit i listen i look round me but i could hear noth nor see anyth i went up to a rise ground to look farther i went up the shore and down the shore but it wa all on i could see no other impress but that on i went to it again to see if there were ani more and to observ if it might not be my fanci but there wa no room for that for there wa exactli the print of a foot toe heel and everi part of a foot how it came thither i knew not nor could i in the least imagin but after innumer flutter thought like a man perfectli confus and out of myself i came home to my fortif not feel as we sai the ground i went on but terrifi to the last degre look behind me at everi two or three step mistak everi bush and tree and fanci everi stump at a distanc to be a man nor is it possibl to describ how mani variou shape my affright imagin repres thing to me in how mani wild idea were found everi moment in my fanci and what strang unaccount whimsi came into my thought by the wai when i came to my castl for so i think i call it ever after thi i fled into it like on pursu whether i went over by the ladder as first contriv or went in at the hole in the rock which i had call a door i cannot rememb no nor could i rememb the next morn for never frighten hare fled to cover or fox to earth with more terror of mind than i to thi retreat i slept none that night the farther i wa from the occas of my fright the greater my apprehens were which is someth contrari to the natur of such thing and especi to the usual practic of all creatur in fear but i wa so embarrass with my own fright idea of the thing that i form noth but dismal imagin to myself even though i wa now a great wai off sometim i fanci it must be the devil and reason join in with me in thi supposit for how should ani other thing in human shape come into the place where wa the vessel that brought them what mark were there of ani other footstep and how wa it possibl a man should come there but then to think that satan should take human shape upon him in such a place where there could be no manner of occas for it but to leav the print of hi foot behind him and that even for no purpos too for he could not be sure i should see it thi wa an amus the other wai i consid that the devil might have found out abund of other wai to have terrifi me than thi of the singl print of a foot that as i live quit on the other side of the island he would never have been so simpl as to leav a mark in a place where it wa ten thousand to on whether i should ever see it or not and in the sand too which the first surg of the sea upon a high wind would have defac entir all thi seem inconsist with the thing itself and with all the notion we usual entertain of the subtleti of the devil abund of such thing as these assist to argu me out of all apprehens of it be the devil and i present conclud then that it must be some more danger creatur viz that it must be some of the savag of the mainland opposit who had wander out to sea in their cano and either driven by the current or by contrari wind had made the island and had been on shore but were gone awai again to sea be as loath perhap to have stai in thi desol island as i would have been to have had them while these reflect were roll in my mind i wa veri thank in my thought that i wa so happi as not to be thereabout at that time or that thei did not see my boat by which thei would have conclud that some inhabit had been in the place and perhap have search farther for me then terribl thought rack my imagin about their have found out my boat and that there were peopl here and that if so i should certainli have them come again in greater number and devour me that if it should happen that thei should not find me yet thei would find my enclosur destroi all my corn and carri awai all my flock of tame goat and i should perish at last for mere want thu my fear banish all my religi hope all that former confid in god which wa found upon such wonder experi as i had had of hi good as if he that had fed me by miracl hitherto could not preserv by hi power the provis which he had made for me by hi good i reproach myself with my lazi that would not sow ani more corn on year than would just serv me till the next season as if no accid could interven to prevent my enjoi the crop that wa upon the ground and thi i thought so just a reproof that i resolv for the futur to have two or three year corn beforehand so that whatev might come i might not perish for want of bread how strang a chequer work of provid is the life of man and by what secret differ spring ar the affect hurri about as differ circumst present to dai we love what to morrow we hate to dai we seek what to morrow we shun to dai we desir what to morrow we fear nai even trembl at the apprehens of thi wa exemplifi in me at thi time in the most live manner imagin for i whose onli afflict wa that i seem banish from human societi that i wa alon circumscrib by the boundless ocean cut off from mankind and condemn to what i call silent life that i wa as on whom heaven thought not worthi to be number among the live or to appear among the rest of hi creatur that to have seen on of my own speci would have seem to me a rais me from death to life and the greatest bless that heaven itself next to the suprem bless of salvat could bestow i sai that i should now trembl at the veri apprehens of see a man and wa readi to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appear of a man have set hi foot in the island such is the uneven state of human life and it afford me a great mani curiou specul afterward when i had a littl recov my first surpris i consid that thi wa the station of life the infinit wise and good provid of god had determin for me that as i could not forese what the end of divin wisdom might be in all thi so i wa not to disput hi sovereignti who as i wa hi creatur had an undoubt right by creation to govern and dispos of me absolut as he thought fit and who as i wa a creatur that had offend him had likewis a judici right to condemn me to what punish he thought fit and that it wa my part to submit to bear hi indign becaus i had sin against him i then reflect that as god who wa not onli righteou but omnipot had thought fit thu to punish and afflict me so he wa abl to deliv me that if he did not think fit to do so it wa my unquest duti to resign myself absolut and entir to hi will and on the other hand it wa my duti also to hope in him prai to him and quietli to attend to the dictat and direct of hi daili provid these thought took me up mani hour dai nai i mai sai week and month and on particular effect of my cogit on thi occas i cannot omit on morn earli ly in my bed and fill with thought about my danger from the appear of savag i found it discompos me veri much upon which these word of the scriptur came into my thought call upon me in the dai of troubl and i will deliv thee and thou shalt glorifi me upon thi rise cheerfulli out of my bed my heart wa not onli comfort but i wa guid and encourag to prai earnestli to god for deliver when i had done prai i took up my bibl and open it to read the first word that present to me were wait on the lord and be of good cheer and he shall strengthen thy heart wait i sai on the lord it is imposs to express the comfort thi gave me in answer i thankfulli laid down the book and wa no more sad at least on that occas in the middl of these cogit apprehens and reflect it came into my thought on dai that all thi might be a mere chimera of my own and that thi foot might be the print of my own foot when i came on shore from my boat thi cheer me up a littl too and i began to persuad myself it wa all a delus that it wa noth els but my own foot and why might i not come that wai from the boat as well as i wa go that wai to the boat again i consid also that i could by no mean tell for certain where i had trod and where i had not and that if at last thi wa onli the print of my own foot i had plai the part of those fool who try to make stori of spectr and apparit and then ar frighten at them more than anybodi now i began to take courag and to peep abroad again for i had not stir out of my castl for three dai and night so that i began to starv for provis for i had littl or noth within door but some barlei cake and water then i knew that my goat want to be milk too which usual wa my even divers and the poor creatur were in great pain and inconveni for want of it and inde it almost spoil some of them and almost dri up their milk encourag myself therefor with the belief that thi wa noth but the print of on of my own feet and that i might be truli said to start at my own shadow i began to go abroad again and went to my countri hous to milk my flock but to see with what fear i went forward how often i look behind me how i wa readi everi now and then to lai down my basket and run for my life it would have made ani on have thought i wa haunt with an evil conscienc or that i had been late most terribl frighten and so inde i had howev i went down thu two or three dai and have seen noth i began to be a littl bolder and to think there wa realli noth in it but my own imagin but i could not persuad myself fulli of thi till i should go down to the shore again and see thi print of a foot and measur it by my own and see if there wa ani similitud or fit that i might be assur it wa my own foot but when i came to the place first it appear evid to me that when i laid up my boat i could not possibl be on shore anywher thereabout secondli when i came to measur the mark with my own foot i found my foot not so larg by a great deal both these thing fill my head with new imagin and gave me the vapour again to the highest degre so that i shook with cold like on in an agu and i went home again fill with the belief that some man or men had been on shore there or in short that the island wa inhabit and i might be surpris befor i wa awar and what cours to take for my secur i knew not oh what ridicul resolut men take when possess with fear it depriv them of the us of those mean which reason offer for their relief the first thing i propos to myself wa to throw down my enclosur and turn all my tame cattl wild into the wood lest the enemi should find them and then frequent the island in prospect of the same or the like booti then the simpl thing of dig up my two corn field lest thei should find such a grain there and still be prompt to frequent the island then to demolish my bower and tent that thei might not see ani vestig of habit and be prompt to look farther in order to find out the person inhabit these were the subject of the first night s cogit after i wa come home again while the apprehens which had so overrun my mind were fresh upon me and my head wa full of vapour thu fear of danger is ten thousand time more terrifi than danger itself when appar to the ey and we find the burden of anxieti greater by much than the evil which we ar anxiou about and what wa wors than all thi i had not that relief in thi troubl that from the resign i us to practis i hope to have i look i thought like saul who complain not onli that the philistin were upon him but that god had forsaken him for i did not now take due wai to compos my mind by cry to god in my distress and rest upon hi provid as i had done befor for my defenc and deliver which if i had done i had at least been more cheerfulli support under thi new surpris and perhap carri through it with more resolut thi confus of my thought kept me awak all night but in the morn i fell asleep and have by the amus of my mind been as it were tire and my spirit exhaust i slept veri soundli and wake much better compos than i had ever been befor and now i began to think sedat and upon debat with myself i conclud that thi island which wa so exceedingli pleasant fruit and no farther from the mainland than as i had seen wa not so entir abandon as i might imagin that although there were no state inhabit who live on the spot yet that there might sometim come boat off from the shore who either with design or perhap never but when thei were driven by cross wind might come to thi place that i had live there fifteen year now and had not met with the least shadow or figur of ani peopl yet and that if at ani time thei should be driven here it wa probabl thei went awai again as soon as ever thei could see thei had never thought fit to fix here upon ani occas that the most i could suggest ani danger from wa from ani casual accident land of straggl peopl from the main who as it wa like if thei were driven hither were here against their will so thei made no stai here but went off again with all possibl speed seldom stai on night on shore lest thei should not have the help of the tide and daylight back again and that therefor i had noth to do but to consid of some safe retreat in case i should see ani savag land upon the spot now i began sore to repent that i had dug my cave so larg as to bring a door through again which door as i said came out beyond where my fortif join to the rock upon matur consid thi therefor i resolv to draw me a second fortif in the manner of a semicircl at a distanc from my wall just where i had plant a doubl row of tree about twelv year befor of which i made mention these tree have been plant so thick befor thei want but few pile to be driven between them that thei might be thicker and stronger and my wall would be soon finish so that i had now a doubl wall and my outer wall wa thicken with piec of timber old cabl and everyth i could think of to make it strong have in it seven littl hole about as big as i might put my arm out at in the insid of thi i thicken my wall to about ten feet thick with continu bring earth out of my cave and lai it at the foot of the wall and walk upon it and through the seven hole i contriv to plant the musket of which i took notic that i had got seven on shore out of the ship these i plant like my cannon and fit them into frame that held them like a carriag so that i could fire all the seven gun in two minut time thi wall i wa mani a weari month in finish and yet never thought myself safe till it wa done when thi wa done i stuck all the ground without my wall for a great length everi wai as full with stake or stick of the osier like wood which i found so apt to grow as thei could well stand insomuch that i believ i might set in near twenti thousand of them leav a pretti larg space between them and my wall that i might have room to see an enemi and thei might have no shelter from the young tree if thei attempt to approach my outer wall thu in two year time i had a thick grove and in five or six year time i had a wood befor my dwell grow so monstrous thick and strong that it wa inde perfectli impass and no men of what kind soever could ever imagin that there wa anyth beyond it much less a habit as for the wai which i propos to myself to go in and out for i left no avenu it wa by set two ladder on to a part of the rock which wa low and then broke in and left room to place anoth ladder upon that so when the two ladder were taken down no man live could come down to me without do himself mischief and if thei had come down thei were still on the outsid of my outer wall thu i took all the measur human prudenc could suggest for my own preserv and it will be seen at length that thei were not altogeth without just reason though i foresaw noth at that time more than my mere fear suggest to me chapter xii a cave retreat while thi wa do i wa not altogeth careless of my other affair for i had a great concern upon me for my littl herd of goat thei were not onli a readi suppli to me on everi occas and began to be suffici for me without the expens of powder and shot but also without the fatigu of hunt after the wild on and i wa loath to lose the advantag of them and to have them all to nurs up over again for thi purpos after long consider i could think of but two wai to preserv them on wa to find anoth conveni place to dig a cave underground and to drive them into it everi night and the other wa to enclos two or three littl bit of land remot from on anoth and as much conceal as i could where i might keep about half a dozen young goat in each place so that if ani disast happen to the flock in gener i might be abl to rais them again with littl troubl and time and thi though it would requir a good deal of time and labour i thought wa the most ration design accordingli i spent some time to find out the most retir part of the island and i pitch upon on which wa as privat inde as my heart could wish it wa a littl damp piec of ground in the middl of the hollow and thick wood where as is observ i almost lost myself onc befor endeavour to come back that wai from the eastern part of the island here i found a clear piec of land near three acr so surround with wood that it wa almost an enclosur by natur at least it did not want near so much labour to make it so as the other piec of ground i had work so hard at i immedi went to work with thi piec of ground and in less than a month s time i had so fenc it round that my flock or herd call it which you pleas which were not so wild now as at first thei might be suppos to be were well enough secur in it so without ani further delai i remov ten young she goat and two he goat to thi piec and when thei were there i continu to perfect the fenc till i had made it as secur as the other which howev i did at more leisur and it took me up more time by a great deal all thi labour i wa at the expens of pure from my apprehens on account of the print of a man s foot for as yet i had never seen ani human creatur come near the island and i had now live two year under thi uneasi which inde made my life much less comfort than it wa befor as mai be well imagin by ani who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of man and thi i must observ with grief too that the discomposur of my mind had great impress also upon the religi part of my thought for the dread and terror of fall into the hand of savag and cannib lai so upon my spirit that i seldom found myself in a due temper for applic to my maker at least not with the sedat calm and resign of soul which i wa wont to do i rather prai to god as under great afflict and pressur of mind surround with danger and in expect everi night of be murder and devour befor morn and i must testifi from my experi that a temper of peac thank love and affect is much the more proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposur and that under the dread of mischief impend a man is no more fit for a comfort perform of the duti of prai to god than he is for a repent on a sick bed for these discomposur affect the mind as the other do the bodi and the discomposur of the mind must necessarili be as great a disabl as that of the bodi and much greater prai to god be properli an act of the mind not of the bodi but to go on after i had thu secur on part of my littl live stock i went about the whole island search for anoth privat place to make such anoth deposit when wander more to the west point of the island than i had ever done yet and look out to sea i thought i saw a boat upon the sea at a great distanc i had found a perspect glass or two in on of the seamen s chest which i save out of our ship but i had it not about me and thi wa so remot that i could not tell what to make of it though i look at it till my ey were not abl to hold to look ani longer whether it wa a boat or not i do not know but as i descend from the hill i could see no more of it so i gave it over onli i resolv to go no more out without a perspect glass in my pocket when i wa come down the hill to the end of the island where inde i had never been befor i wa present convinc that the see the print of a man s foot wa not such a strang thing in the island as i imagin and but that it wa a special provid that i wa cast upon the side of the island where the savag never came i should easili have known that noth wa more frequent than for the cano from the main when thei happen to be a littl too far out at sea to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour likewis as thei often met and fought in their cano the victor have taken ani prison would bring them over to thi shore where accord to their dread custom be all cannib thei would kill and eat them of which hereaft when i wa come down the hill to the shore as i said abov be the sw point of the island i wa perfectli confound and amaz nor is it possibl for me to express the horror of my mind at see the shore spread with skull hand feet and other bone of human bodi and particularli i observ a place where there had been a fire made and a circl dug in the earth like a cockpit where i suppos the savag wretch had sat down to their human feast upon the bodi of their fellow creatur i wa so astonish with the sight of these thing that i entertain no notion of ani danger to myself from it for a long while all my apprehens were buri in the thought of such a pitch of inhuman hellish brutal and the horror of the degeneraci of human natur which though i had heard of it often yet i never had so near a view of befor in short i turn awai my face from the horrid spectacl my stomach grew sick and i wa just at the point of faint when natur discharg the disord from my stomach and have vomit with uncommon violenc i wa a littl reliev but could not bear to stai in the place a moment so i got up the hill again with all the speed i could and walk on toward my own habit when i came a littl out of that part of the island i stood still awhil as amaz and then recov myself i look up with the utmost affect of my soul and with a flood of tear in my ey gave god thank that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where i wa distinguish from such dread creatur as these and that though i had esteem my present condit veri miser had yet given me so mani comfort in it that i had still more to give thank for than to complain of and thi abov all that i had even in thi miser condit been comfort with the knowledg of himself and the hope of hi bless which wa a felic more than suffici equival to all the miseri which i had suffer or could suffer in thi frame of thank i went home to my castl and began to be much easier now as to the safeti of my circumst than ever i wa befor for i observ that these wretch never came to thi island in search of what thei could get perhap not seek not want or not expect anyth here and have often no doubt been up the cover woodi part of it without find anyth to their purpos i knew i had been here now almost eighteen year and never saw the least footstep of human creatur there befor and i might be eighteen year more as entir conceal as i wa now if i did not discov myself to them which i had no manner of occas to do it be my onli busi to keep myself entir conceal where i wa unless i found a better sort of creatur than cannib to make myself known to yet i entertain such an abhorr of the savag wretch that i have been speak of and of the wretch inhuman custom of their devour and eat on anoth up that i continu pensiv and sad and kept close within my own circl for almost two year after thi when i sai my own circl i mean by it my three plantat viz my castl my countri seat which i call my bower and my enclosur in the wood nor did i look after thi for ani other us than an enclosur for my goat for the avers which natur gave me to these hellish wretch wa such that i wa as fear of see them as of see the devil himself i did not so much as go to look after my boat all thi time but began rather to think of make anoth for i could not think of ever make ani more attempt to bring the other boat round the island to me lest i should meet with some of these creatur at sea in which case if i had happen to have fallen into their hand i knew what would have been my lot time howev and the satisfact i had that i wa in no danger of be discov by these peopl began to wear off my uneasi about them and i began to live just in the same compos manner as befor onli with thi differ that i us more caution and kept my ey more about me than i did befor lest i should happen to be seen by ani of them and particularli i wa more cautiou of fire my gun lest ani of them be on the island should happen to hear it it wa therefor a veri good provid to me that i had furnish myself with a tame breed of goat and that i had no need to hunt ani more about the wood or shoot at them and if i did catch ani of them after thi it wa by trap and snare as i had done befor so that for two year after thi i believ i never fire my gun onc off though i never went out without it and what wa more as i had save three pistol out of the ship i alwai carri them out with me or at least two of them stick them in my goat skin belt i also furbish up on of the great cutlass that i had out of the ship and made me a belt to hang it on also so that i wa now a most formid fellow to look at when i went abroad if you add to the former descript of myself the particular of two pistol and a broadsword hang at my side in a belt but without a scabbard thing go on thu as i have said for some time i seem except these caution to be reduc to my former calm sedat wai of live all these thing tend to show me more and more how far my condit wa from be miser compar to some other nai to mani other particular of life which it might have pleas god to have made my lot it put me upon reflect how littl repin there would be among mankind at ani condit of life if peopl would rather compar their condit with those that were wors in order to be thank than be alwai compar them with those which ar better to assist their murmur and complain as in my present condit there were not realli mani thing which i want so inde i thought that the fright i had been in about these savag wretch and the concern i had been in for my own preserv had taken off the edg of my invent for my own conveni and i had drop a good design which i had onc bent my thought upon and that wa to try if i could not make some of my barlei into malt and then try to brew myself some beer thi wa realli a whimsic thought and i reprov myself often for the simplic of it for i present saw there would be the want of sever thing necessari to the make my beer that it would be imposs for me to suppli as first cask to preserv it in which wa a thing that as i have observ alreadi i could never compass no though i spent not onli mani dai but week nai month in attempt it but to no purpos in the next place i had no hop to make it keep no yeast to make it work no copper or kettl to make it boil and yet with all these thing want i verili believ had not the fright and terror i wa in about the savag interven i had undertaken it and perhap brought it to pass too for i seldom gave anyth over without accomplish it when onc i had it in my head to began it but my invent now ran quit anoth wai for night and dai i could think of noth but how i might destroi some of the monster in their cruel bloodi entertain and if possibl save the victim thei should bring hither to destroi it would take up a larger volum than thi whole work is intend to be to set down all the contriv i hatch or rather brood upon in my thought for the destroi these creatur or at least frighten them so as to prevent their come hither ani more but all thi wa abort noth could be possibl to take effect unless i wa to be there to do it myself and what could on man do among them when perhap there might be twenti or thirti of them togeth with their dart or their bow and arrow with which thei could shoot as true to a mark as i could with my gun sometim i thought if dig a hole under the place where thei made their fire and put in five or six pound of gunpowd which when thei kindl their fire would consequ take fire and blow up all that wa near it but as in the first place i should be unwil to wast so much powder upon them my store be now within the quantiti of on barrel so neither could i be sure of it go off at ani certain time when it might surpris them and at best that it would do littl more than just blow the fire about their ear and fright them but not suffici to make them forsak the place so i laid it asid and then propos that i would place myself in ambush in some conveni place with my three gun all doubl load and in the middl of their bloodi ceremoni let fly at them when i should be sure to kill or wound perhap two or three at everi shot and then fall in upon them with my three pistol and my sword i made no doubt but that if there were twenti i should kill them all thi fanci pleas my thought for some week and i wa so full of it that i often dream of it and sometim that i wa just go to let fly at them in my sleep i went so far with it in my imagin that i emploi myself sever dai to find out proper place to put myself in ambuscad as i said to watch for them and i went frequent to the place itself which wa now grown more familiar to me but while my mind wa thu fill with thought of reveng and a bloodi put twenti or thirti of them to the sword as i mai call it the horror i had at the place and at the signal of the barbar wretch devour on anoth abet my malic well at length i found a place in the side of the hill where i wa satisfi i might secur wait till i saw ani of their boat come and might then even befor thei would be readi to come on shore convei myself unseen into some thicket of tree in on of which there wa a hollow larg enough to conceal me entir and there i might sit and observ all their bloodi do and take my full aim at their head when thei were so close togeth as that it would be next to imposs that i should miss my shot or that i could fail wound three or four of them at the first shot in thi place then i resolv to fulfil my design and accordingli i prepar two musket and my ordinari fowl piec the two musket i load with a brace of slug each and four or five smaller bullet about the size of pistol bullet and the fowl piec i load with near a hand of swan shot of the largest size i also load my pistol with about four bullet each and in thi postur well provid with ammunit for a second and third charg i prepar myself for my expedit after i had thu laid the scheme of my design and in my imagin put it in practic i continu made my tour everi morn to the top of the hill which wa from my castl as i call it about three mile or more to see if i could observ ani boat upon the sea come near the island or stand over toward it but i began to tire of thi hard duti after i had for two or three month constantli kept my watch but came alwai back without ani discoveri there have not in all that time been the least appear not onli on or near the shore but on the whole ocean so far as my ey or glass could reach everi wai as long as i kept my daili tour to the hill to look out so long also i kept up the vigour of my design and my spirit seem to be all the while in a suitabl frame for so outrag an execut as the kill twenti or thirti nake savag for an offenc which i had not at all enter into ani discuss of in my thought ani farther than my passion were at first fire by the horror i conceiv at the unnatur custom of the peopl of that countri who it seem had been suffer by provid in hi wise disposit of the world to have no other guid than that of their own abomin and vitiat passion and consequ were left and perhap had been so for some ag to act such horrid thing and receiv such dread custom as noth but natur entir abandon by heaven and actuat by some hellish degeneraci could have run them into but now when as i have said i began to be weari of the fruitless excurs which i had made so long and so far everi morn in vain so my opinion of the action itself began to alter and i began with cooler and calmer thought to consid what i wa go to engag in what author or call i had to pretend to be judg and execution upon these men as crimin whom heaven had thought fit for so mani ag to suffer unpunish to go on and to be as it were the execution of hi judgment on upon anoth how far these peopl were offend against me and what right i had to engag in the quarrel of that blood which thei shed promiscu upon on anoth i debat thi veri often with myself thu how do i know what god himself judg in thi particular case it is certain these peopl do not commit thi as a crime it is not against their own conscienc reprov or their light reproach them thei do not know it to be an offenc and then commit it in defianc of divin justic as we do in almost all the sin we commit thei think it no more a crime to kill a captiv taken in war than we do to kill an ox or to eat human flesh than we do to eat mutton when i consid thi a littl it follow necessarili that i wa certainli in the wrong that these peopl were not murder in the sens that i had befor condemn them in my thought ani more than those christian were murder who often put to death the prison taken in battl or more frequent upon mani occas put whole troop of men to the sword without give quarter though thei threw down their arm and submit in the next place it occur to me that although the usag thei gave on anoth wa thu brutish and inhuman yet it wa realli noth to me these peopl had done me no injuri that if thei attempt or i saw it necessari for my immedi preserv to fall upon them someth might be said for it but that i wa yet out of their power and thei realli had no knowledg of me and consequ no design upon me and therefor it could not be just for me to fall upon them that thi would justifi the conduct of the spaniard in all their barbar practis in america where thei destroi million of these peopl who howev thei were idol and barbarian and had sever bloodi and barbar rite in their custom such as sacrif human bodi to their idol were yet as to the spaniard veri innoc peopl and that the root them out of the countri is spoken of with the utmost abhorr and detest by even the spaniard themselv at thi time and by all other christian nation of europ as a mere butcheri a bloodi and unnatur piec of cruelti unjustifi either to god or man and for which the veri name of a spaniard is reckon to be fright and terribl to all peopl of human or of christian compass as if the kingdom of spain were particularli emin for the produc of a race of men who were without principl of tender or the common bowel of piti to the miser which is reckon to be a mark of gener temper in the mind these consider realli put me to a paus and to a kind of a full stop and i began by littl and littl to be off my design and to conclud i had taken wrong measur in my resolut to attack the savag and that it wa not my busi to meddl with them unless thei first attack me and thi it wa my busi if possibl to prevent but that if i were discov and attack by them i knew my duti on the other hand i argu with myself that thi realli wa the wai not to deliv myself but entir to ruin and destroi myself for unless i wa sure to kill everi on that not onli should be on shore at that time but that should ever come on shore afterward if but on of them escap to tell their countri peopl what had happen thei would come over again by thousand to reveng the death of their fellow and i should onli bring upon myself a certain destruct which at present i had no manner of occas for upon the whole i conclud that i ought neither in principl nor in polici on wai or other to concern myself in thi affair that my busi wa by all possibl mean to conceal myself from them and not to leav the least sign for them to guess by that there were ani live creatur upon the island i mean of human shape religion join in with thi prudenti resolut and i wa convinc now mani wai that i wa perfectli out of my duti when i wa lai all my bloodi scheme for the destruct of innoc creatur i mean innoc as to me as to the crime thei were guilti of toward on anoth i had noth to do with them thei were nation and i ought to leav them to the justic of god who is the governor of nation and know how by nation punish to make a just retribut for nation offenc and to bring public judgment upon those who offend in a public manner by such wai as best pleas him thi appear so clear to me now that noth wa a greater satisfact to me than that i had not been suffer to do a thing which i now saw so much reason to believ would have been no less a sin than that of wil murder if i had commit it and i gave most humbl thank on my knee to god that he had thu deliv me from blood guilti beseech him to grant me the protect of hi provid that i might not fall into the hand of the barbarian or that i might not lai my hand upon them unless i had a more clear call from heaven to do it in defenc of my own life in thi disposit i continu for near a year after thi and so far wa i from desir an occas for fall upon these wretch that in all that time i never onc went up the hill to see whether there were ani of them in sight or to know whether ani of them had been on shore there or not that i might not be tempt to renew ani of my contriv against them or be provok by ani advantag that might present itself to fall upon them onli thi i did i went and remov my boat which i had on the other side of the island and carri it down to the east end of the whole island where i ran it into a littl cove which i found under some high rock and where i knew by reason of the current the savag durst not at least would not come with their boat upon ani account whatev with my boat i carri awai everyth that i had left there belong to her though not necessari for the bare go thither viz a mast and sail which i had made for her and a thing like an anchor but which inde could not be call either anchor or grapnel howev it wa the best i could make of it kind all these i remov that there might not be the least shadow for discoveri or appear of ani boat or of ani human habit upon the island besid thi i kept myself as i said more retir than ever and seldom went from my cell except upon my constant employ to milk my she goat and manag my littl flock in the wood which as it wa quit on the other part of the island wa out of danger for certain it is that these savag peopl who sometim haunt thi island never came with ani thought of find anyth here and consequ never wander off from the coast and i doubt not but thei might have been sever time on shore after my apprehens of them had made me cautiou as well as befor inde i look back with some horror upon the thought of what my condit would have been if i had chop upon them and been discov befor that when nake and unarm except with on gun and that load often onli with small shot i walk everywher peep and peer about the island to see what i could get what a surpris should i have been in if when i discov the print of a man s foot i had instead of that seen fifteen or twenti savag and found them pursu me and by the swift of their run no possibl of my escap them the thought of thi sometim sank my veri soul within me and distress my mind so much that i could not soon recov it to think what i should have done and how i should not onli have been unabl to resist them but even should not have had presenc of mind enough to do what i might have done much less what now after so much consider and prepar i might be abl to do inde after seriou think of these thing i would be melancholi and sometim it would last a great while but i resolv it all at last into thank to that provid which had deliv me from so mani unseen danger and had kept me from those mischief which i could have no wai been the agent in deliv myself from becaus i had not the least notion of ani such thing depend or the least supposit of it be possibl thi renew a contempl which often had come into my thought in former time when first i began to see the merci disposit of heaven in the danger we run through in thi life how wonderfulli we ar deliv when we know noth of it how when we ar in a quandari as we call it a doubt or hesit whether to go thi wai or that wai a secret hint shall direct us thi wai when we intend to go that wai nai when sens our own inclin and perhap busi ha call us to go the other wai yet a strang impress upon the mind from we know not what spring and by we know not what power shall overrul us to go thi wai and it shall afterward appear that had we gone that wai which we should have gone and even to our imagin ought to have gone we should have been ruin and lost upon these and mani like reflect i afterward made it a certain rule with me that whenev i found those secret hint or press of mind to do or not do anyth that present or go thi wai or that wai i never fail to obei the secret dictat though i knew no other reason for it than such a pressur or such a hint hung upon my mind i could give mani exampl of the success of thi conduct in the cours of my life but more especi in the latter part of my inhabit thi unhappi island besid mani occas which it is veri like i might have taken notic of if i had seen with the same ey then that i see with now but it is never too late to be wise and i cannot but advis all consid men whose live ar attend with such extraordinari incid as mine or even though not so extraordinari not to slight such secret intim of provid let them come from what invis intellig thei will that i shall not discuss and perhap cannot account for but certainli thei ar a proof of the convers of spirit and a secret commun between those embodi and those unembodi and such a proof as can never be withstood of which i shall have occas to give some remark instanc in the remaind of my solitari resid in thi dismal place i believ the reader of thi will not think it strang if i confess that these anxieti these constant danger i live in and the concern that wa now upon me put an end to all invent and to all the contriv that i had laid for my futur accommod and conveni i had the care of my safeti more now upon my hand than that of my food i care not to drive a nail or chop a stick of wood now for fear the nois i might make should be heard much less would i fire a gun for the same reason and abov all i wa intoler uneasi at make ani fire lest the smoke which is visibl at a great distanc in the dai should betrai me for thi reason i remov that part of my busi which requir fire such as burn of pot and pipe c into my new apart in the wood where after i had been some time i found to my unspeak consol a mere natur cave in the earth which went in a vast wai and where i daresai no savag had he been at the mouth of it would be so hardi as to ventur in nor inde would ani man els but on who like me want noth so much as a safe retreat the mouth of thi hollow wa at the bottom of a great rock where by mere accid i would sai if i did not see abund reason to ascrib all such thing now to provid i wa cut down some thick branch of tree to make charcoal and befor i go on i must observ the reason of my make thi charcoal which wa thi i wa afraid of make a smoke about my habit as i said befor and yet i could not live there without bake my bread cook my meat c so i contriv to burn some wood here as i had seen done in england under turf till it becam chark or dry coal and then put the fire out i preserv the coal to carri home and perform the other servic for which fire wa want without danger of smoke but thi is by the bye while i wa cut down some wood here i perceiv that behind a veri thick branch of low brushwood or underwood there wa a kind of hollow place i wa curiou to look in it and get with difficulti into the mouth of it i found it wa pretti larg that is to sai suffici for me to stand upright in it and perhap anoth with me but i must confess to you that i made more hast out than i did in when look farther into the place and which wa perfectli dark i saw two broad shine ey of some creatur whether devil or man i knew not which twinkl like two star the dim light from the cave s mouth shine directli in and make the reflect howev after some paus i recov myself and began to call myself a thousand fool and to think that he that wa afraid to see the devil wa not fit to live twenti year in an island all alon and that i might well think there wa noth in thi cave that wa more fright than myself upon thi pluck up my courag i took up a firebrand and in i rush again with the stick flame in my hand i had not gone three step in befor i wa almost as frighten as befor for i heard a veri loud sigh like that of a man in some pain and it wa follow by a broken nois as of word half express and then a deep sigh again i step back and wa inde struck with such a surpris that it put me into a cold sweat and if i had had a hat on my head i will not answer for it that my hair might not have lift it off but still pluck up my spirit as well as i could and encourag myself a littl with consid that the power and presenc of god wa everywher and wa abl to protect me i step forward again and by the light of the firebrand hold it up a littl over my head i saw ly on the ground a monstrou fright old he goat just make hi will as we sai and gasp for life and dy inde of mere old ag i stir him a littl to see if i could get him out and he essai to get up but wa not abl to rais himself and i thought with myself he might even lie there for if he had frighten me so he would certainli fright ani of the savag if ani of them should be so hardi as to come in there while he had ani life in him i wa now recov from my surpris and began to look round me when i found the cave wa but veri small that is to sai it might be about twelv feet over but in no manner of shape neither round nor squar no hand have ever been emploi in make it but those of mere natur i observ also that there wa a place at the farther side of it that went in further but wa so low that it requir me to creep upon my hand and knee to go into it and whither it went i knew not so have no candl i gave it over for that time but resolv to go again the next dai provid with candl and a tinder box which i had made of the lock of on of the musket with some wildfir in the pan accordingli the next dai i came provid with six larg candl of my own make for i made veri good candl now of goat s tallow but wa hard set for candl wick us sometim rag or rope yarn and sometim the dri rind of a weed like nettl and go into thi low place i wa oblig to creep upon all four as i have said almost ten yard which by the wai i thought wa a ventur bold enough consid that i knew not how far it might go nor what wa beyond it when i had got through the strait i found the roof rose higher up i believ near twenti feet but never wa such a gloriou sight seen in the island i daresai as it wa to look round the side and roof of thi vault or cave the wall reflect a hundr thousand light to me from my two candl what it wa in the rock whether diamond or ani other preciou stone or gold which i rather suppos it to be i knew not the place i wa in wa a most delight caviti or grotto though perfectli dark the floor wa dry and level and had a sort of a small loos gravel upon it so that there wa no nauseou or venom creatur to be seen neither wa there ani damp or wet on the side or roof the onli difficulti in it wa the entranc which howev as it wa a place of secur and such a retreat as i want i thought wa a conveni so that i wa realli rejoic at the discoveri and resolv without ani delai to bring some of those thing which i wa most anxiou about to thi place particularli i resolv to bring hither my magazin of powder and all my spare arm viz two fowl piec for i had three in all and three musket for of them i had eight in all so i kept in my castl onli five which stood readi mount like piec of cannon on my outmost fenc and were readi also to take out upon ani expedit upon thi occas of remov my ammunit i happen to open the barrel of powder which i took up out of the sea and which had been wet and i found that the water had penetr about three or four inch into the powder on everi side which cake and grow hard had preserv the insid like a kernel in the shell so that i had near sixti pound of veri good powder in the centr of the cask thi wa a veri agreeabl discoveri to me at that time so i carri all awai thither never keep abov two or three pound of powder with me in my castl for fear of a surpris of ani kind i also carri thither all the lead i had left for bullet i fanci myself now like on of the ancient giant who were said to live in cave and hole in the rock where none could come at them for i persuad myself while i wa here that if five hundr savag were to hunt me thei could never find me out or if thei did thei would not ventur to attack me here the old goat whom i found expir di in the mouth of the cave the next dai after i made thi discoveri and i found it much easier to dig a great hole there and throw him in and cover him with earth than to drag him out so i inter him there to prevent offenc to my nose chapter xiii wreck of a spanish ship i wa now in the twenti third year of my resid in thi island and wa so naturalis to the place and the manner of live that could i but have enjoi the certainti that no savag would come to the place to disturb me i could have been content to have capitul for spend the rest of my time there even to the last moment till i had laid me down and di like the old goat in the cave i had also arriv to some littl divers and amus which made the time pass a great deal more pleasantli with me than it did befor first i had taught my poll as i note befor to speak and he did it so familiarli and talk so articul and plain that it wa veri pleasant to me and he live with me no less than six and twenti year how long he might have live afterward i know not though i know thei have a notion in the brazil that thei live a hundr year my dog wa a pleasant and love companion to me for no less than sixteen year of my time and then di of mere old ag as for my cat thei multipli as i have observ to that degre that i wa oblig to shoot sever of them at first to keep them from devour me and all i had but at length when the two old on i brought with me were gone and after some time continu drive them from me and let them have no provis with me thei all ran wild into the wood except two or three favourit which i kept tame and whose young when thei had ani i alwai drown and these were part of my famili besid these i alwai kept two or three household kid about me whom i taught to feed out of my hand and i had two more parrot which talk pretti well and would all call robin cruso but none like my first nor inde did i take the pain with ani of them that i had done with him i had also sever tame sea fowl whose name i knew not that i caught upon the shore and cut their wing and the littl stake which i had plant befor my castl wall be now grown up to a good thick grove these fowl all live among these low tree and bred there which wa veri agreeabl to me so that as i said abov i began to be veri well content with the life i led if i could have been secur from the dread of the savag but it wa otherwis direct and it mai not be amiss for all peopl who shall meet with my stori to make thi just observ from it how frequent in the cours of our live the evil which in itself we seek most to shun and which when we ar fallen into is the most dread to us is oftentim the veri mean or door of our deliver by which alon we can be rais again from the afflict we ar fallen into i could give mani exampl of thi in the cours of my unaccount life but in noth wa it more particularli remark than in the circumst of my last year of solitari resid in thi island it wa now the month of decemb as i said abov in my twenti third year and thi be the southern solstic for winter i cannot call it wa the particular time of my harvest and requir me to be pretti much abroad in the field when go out earli in the morn even befor it wa thorough daylight i wa surpris with see a light of some fire upon the shore at a distanc from me of about two mile toward that part of the island where i had observ some savag had been as befor and not on the other side but to my great afflict it wa on my side of the island i wa inde terribl surpris at the sight and stop short within my grove not dare to go out lest i might be surpris and yet i had no more peac within from the apprehens i had that if these savag in rambl over the island should find my corn stand or cut or ani of my work or improv thei would immedi conclud that there were peopl in the place and would then never rest till thei had found me out in thi extrem i went back directli to my castl pull up the ladder after me and made all thing without look as wild and natur as i could then i prepar myself within put myself in a postur of defenc i load all my cannon as i call them that is to sai my musket which were mount upon my new fortif and all my pistol and resolv to defend myself to the last gasp not forget serious to commend myself to the divin protect and earnestli to prai to god to deliv me out of the hand of the barbarian i continu in thi postur about two hour and began to be impati for intellig abroad for i had no spi to send out after sit a while longer and muse what i should do in thi case i wa not abl to bear sit in ignor longer so set up my ladder to the side of the hill where there wa a flat place as i observ befor and then pull the ladder after me i set it up again and mount the top of the hill and pull out my perspect glass which i had taken on purpos i laid me down flat on my belli on the ground and began to look for the place i present found there were no less than nine nake savag sit round a small fire thei had made not to warm them for thei had no need of that the weather be extrem hot but as i suppos to dress some of their barbar diet of human flesh which thei had brought with them whether aliv or dead i could not tell thei had two cano with them which thei had haul up upon the shore and as it wa then ebb of tide thei seem to me to wait for the return of the flood to go awai again it is not easi to imagin what confus thi sight put me into especi see them come on my side of the island and so near to me but when i consid their come must be alwai with the current of the ebb i began afterward to be more sedat in my mind be satisfi that i might go abroad with safeti all the time of the flood of tide if thei were not on shore befor and have made thi observ i went abroad about my harvest work with the more composur as i expect so it prove for as soon as the tide made to the westward i saw them all take boat and row or paddl as we call it awai i should have observ that for an hour or more befor thei went off thei were danc and i could easili discern their postur and gestur by my glass i could not perceiv by my nicest observ but that thei were stark nake and had not the least cover upon them but whether thei were men or women i could not distinguish as soon as i saw them ship and gone i took two gun upon my shoulder and two pistol in my girdl and my great sword by my side without a scabbard and with all the speed i wa abl to make went awai to the hill where i had discov the first appear of all and as soon as i got thither which wa not in less than two hour for i could not go quickli be so load with arm as i wa i perceiv there had been three cano more of the savag at that place and look out farther i saw thei were all at sea togeth make over for the main thi wa a dread sight to me especi as go down to the shore i could see the mark of horror which the dismal work thei had been about had left behind it viz the blood the bone and part of the flesh of human bodi eaten and devour by those wretch with merriment and sport i wa so fill with indign at the sight that i now began to premedit the destruct of the next that i saw there let them be whom or how mani soever it seem evid to me that the visit which thei made thu to thi island were not veri frequent for it wa abov fifteen month befor ani more of them came on shore there again that is to sai i neither saw them nor ani footstep or signal of them in all that time for as to the raini season then thei ar sure not to come abroad at least not so far yet all thi while i live uncomfort by reason of the constant apprehens of their come upon me by surpris from whenc i observ that the expect of evil is more bitter than the suffer especi if there is no room to shake off that expect or those apprehens dure all thi time i wa in a murder humour and spent most of my hour which should have been better emploi in contriv how to circumv and fall upon them the veri next time i should see them especi if thei should be divid as thei were the last time into two parti nor did i consid at all that if i kill on parti suppos ten or a dozen i wa still the next dai or week or month to kill anoth and so anoth even ad infinitum till i should be at length no less a murder than thei were in be man eater and perhap much more so i spent my dai now in great perplex and anxieti of mind expect that i should on dai or other fall into the hand of these merciless creatur and if i did at ani time ventur abroad it wa not without look around me with the greatest care and caution imagin and now i found to my great comfort how happi it wa that i had provid a tame flock or herd of goat for i durst not upon ani account fire my gun especi near that side of the island where thei usual came lest i should alarm the savag and if thei had fled from me now i wa sure to have them come again with perhap two or three hundr cano with them in a few dai and then i knew what to expect howev i wore out a year and three month more befor i ever saw ani more of the savag and then i found them again as i shall soon observ it is true thei might have been there onc or twice but either thei made no stai or at least i did not see them but in the month of mai as near as i could calcul and in my four and twentieth year i had a veri strang encount with them of which in it place the perturb of my mind dure thi fifteen or sixteen month interv wa veri great i slept unquietli dream alwai fright dream and often start out of my sleep in the night in the dai great troubl overwhelm my mind and in the night i dream often of kill the savag and of the reason why i might justifi do it but to waiv all thi for a while it wa in the middl of mai on the sixteenth dai i think as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon for i mark all upon the post still i sai it wa on the sixteenth of mai that it blew a veri great storm of wind all dai with a great deal of lightn and thunder and a veri foul night it wa after it i knew not what wa the particular occas of it but as i wa read in the bibl and taken up with veri seriou thought about my present condit i wa surpris with the nois of a gun as i thought fire at sea thi wa to be sure a surpris quit of a differ natur from ani i had met with befor for the notion thi put into my thought were quit of anoth kind i start up in the greatest hast imagin and in a trice clap my ladder to the middl place of the rock and pull it after me and mount it the second time got to the top of the hill the veri moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a second gun which accordingli in about half a minut i heard and by the sound knew that it wa from that part of the sea where i wa driven down the current in my boat i immedi consid that thi must be some ship in distress and that thei had some comrad or some other ship in compani and fire these for signal of distress and to obtain help i had the presenc of mind at that minut to think that though i could not help them it might be that thei might help me so i brought togeth all the dry wood i could get at hand and make a good handsom pile i set it on fire upon the hill the wood wa dry and blaze freeli and though the wind blew veri hard yet it burn fairli out so that i wa certain if there wa ani such thing as a ship thei must need see it and no doubt thei did for as soon as ever my fire blaze up i heard anoth gun and after that sever other all from the same quarter i pli my fire all night long till daybreak and when it wa broad dai and the air clear up i saw someth at a great distanc at sea full east of the island whether a sail or a hull i could not distinguish no not with my glass the distanc wa so great and the weather still someth hazi also at least it wa so out at sea i look frequent at it all that dai and soon perceiv that it did not move so i present conclud that it wa a ship at anchor and be eager you mai be sure to be satisfi i took my gun in my hand and ran toward the south side of the island to the rock where i had formerli been carri awai by the current and get up there the weather by thi time be perfectli clear i could plainli see to my great sorrow the wreck of a ship cast awai in the night upon those conceal rock which i found when i wa out in my boat and which rock as thei check the violenc of the stream and made a kind of counter stream or eddi were the occas of my recov from the most desper hopeless condit that ever i had been in in all my life thu what is on man s safeti is anoth man s destruct for it seem these men whoever thei were be out of their knowledg and the rock be wholli under water had been driven upon them in the night the wind blow hard at en had thei seen the island as i must necessarili suppos thei did not thei must as i thought have endeavour to have save themselv on shore by the help of their boat but their fire off gun for help especi when thei saw as i imagin my fire fill me with mani thought first i imagin that upon see my light thei might have put themselv into their boat and endeavour to make the shore but that the sea run veri high thei might have been cast awai other time i imagin that thei might have lost their boat befor as might be the case mani wai particularli by the break of the sea upon their ship which mani time oblig men to stave or take in piec their boat and sometim to throw it overboard with their own hand other time i imagin thei had some other ship or ship in compani who upon the signal of distress thei made had taken them up and carri them off other time i fanci thei were all gone off to sea in their boat and be hurri awai by the current that i had been formerli in were carri out into the great ocean where there wa noth but miseri and perish and that perhap thei might by thi time think of starv and of be in a condit to eat on anoth as all these were but conjectur at best so in the condit i wa in i could do no more than look on upon the miseri of the poor men and piti them which had still thi good effect upon my side that it gave me more and more caus to give thank to god who had so happili and comfort provid for me in my desol condit and that of two ship compani who were now cast awai upon thi part of the world not on life should be spare but mine i learn here again to observ that it is veri rare that the provid of god cast us into ani condit so low or ani miseri so great but we mai see someth or other to be thank for and mai see other in wors circumst than our own such certainli wa the case of these men of whom i could not so much as see room to suppos ani were save noth could make it ration so much as to wish or expect that thei did not all perish there except the possibl onli of their be taken up by anoth ship in compani and thi wa but mere possibl inde for i saw not the least sign or appear of ani such thing i cannot explain by ani possibl energi of word what a strang long i felt in my soul upon thi sight break out sometim thu oh that there had been but on or two nai or but on soul save out of thi ship to have escap to me that i might but have had on companion on fellow creatur to have spoken to me and to have convers with in all the time of my solitari life i never felt so earnest so strong a desir after the societi of my fellow creatur or so deep a regret at the want of it there ar some secret spring in the affect which when thei ar set a go by some object in view or though not in view yet render present to the mind by the power of imagin that motion carri out the soul by it impetuos to such violent eager embrac of the object that the absenc of it is insupport such were these earnest wish that but on man had been save i believ i repeat the word oh that it had been but on a thousand time and my desir were so move by it that when i spoke the word my hand would clinch togeth and my finger would press the palm of my hand so that if i had had ani soft thing in my hand i should have crush it involuntarili and the teeth in my head would strike togeth and set against on anoth so strong that for some time i could not part them again let the naturalist explain these thing and the reason and manner of them all i can do is to describ the fact which wa even surpris to me when i found it though i knew not from whenc it proceed it wa doubtless the effect of ardent wish and of strong idea form in my mind realis the comfort which the convers of on of my fellow christian would have been to me but it wa not to be either their fate or mine or both forbad it for till the last year of my be on thi island i never knew whether ani were save out of that ship or no and had onli the afflict some dai after to see the corps of a drown boi come on shore at the end of the island which wa next the shipwreck he had no cloth on but a seaman s waistcoat a pair of open kneed linen drawer and a blue linen shirt but noth to direct me so much as to guess what nation he wa of he had noth in hi pocket but two piec of eight and a tobacco pipe the last wa to me of ten time more valu than the first it wa now calm and i had a great mind to ventur out in my boat to thi wreck not doubt but i might find someth on board that might be us to me but that did not altogeth press me so much as the possibl that there might be yet some live creatur on board whose life i might not onli save but might by save that life comfort my own to the last degre and thi thought clung so to my heart that i could not be quiet night or dai but i must ventur out in my boat on board thi wreck and commit the rest to god s provid i thought the impress wa so strong upon my mind that it could not be resist that it must come from some invis direct and that i should be want to myself if i did not go under the power of thi impress i hasten back to my castl prepar everyth for my voyag took a quantiti of bread a great pot of fresh water a compass to steer by a bottl of rum for i had still a great deal of that left and a basket of raisin and thu load myself with everyth necessari i went down to my boat got the water out of her got her afloat load all my cargo in her and then went home again for more my second cargo wa a great bag of rice the umbrella to set up over my head for a shade anoth larg pot of water and about two dozen of small loav or barlei cake more than befor with a bottl of goat s milk and a chees all which with great labour and sweat i carri to my boat and prai to god to direct my voyag i put out and row or paddl the cano along the shore came at last to the utmost point of the island on the north east side and now i wa to launch out into the ocean and either to ventur or not to ventur i look on the rapid current which ran constantli on both side of the island at a distanc and which were veri terribl to me from the remembr of the hazard i had been in befor and my heart began to fail me for i foresaw that if i wa driven into either of those current i should be carri a great wai out to sea and perhap out of my reach or sight of the island again and that then as my boat wa but small if ani littl gale of wind should rise i should be inevit lost these thought so oppress my mind that i began to give over my enterpris and have haul my boat into a littl creek on the shore i step out and sat down upon a rise bit of ground veri pensiv and anxiou between fear and desir about my voyag when as i wa muse i could perceiv that the tide wa turn and the flood come on upon which my go wa impractic for so mani hour upon thi present it occur to me that i should go up to the highest piec of ground i could find and observ if i could how the set of the tide or current lai when the flood came in that i might judg whether if i wa driven on wai out i might not expect to be driven anoth wai home with the same rapid of the current thi thought wa no sooner in my head than i cast my ey upon a littl hill which suffici overlook the sea both wai and from whenc i had a clear view of the current or set of the tide and which wai i wa to guid myself in my return here i found that as the current of ebb set out close by the south point of the island so the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the north side and that i had noth to do but to keep to the north side of the island in my return and i should do well enough encourag by thi observ i resolv the next morn to set out with the first of the tide and repos myself for the night in my cano under the watch coat i mention i launch out i first made a littl out to sea full north till i began to feel the benefit of the current which set eastward and which carri me at a great rate and yet did not so hurri me as the current on the south side had done befor so as to take from me all govern of the boat but have a strong steerag with my paddl i went at a great rate directli for the wreck and in less than two hour i came up to it it wa a dismal sight to look at the ship which by it build wa spanish stuck fast jam in between two rock all the stern and quarter of her were beaten to piec by the sea and as her forecastl which stuck in the rock had run on with great violenc her mainmast and foremast were brought by the board that is to sai broken short off but her bowsprit wa sound and the head and bow appear firm when i came close to her a dog appear upon her who see me come yelp and cri and as soon as i call him jump into the sea to come to me i took him into the boat but found him almost dead with hunger and thirst i gave him a cake of my bread and he devour it like a raven wolf that had been starv a fortnight in the snow i then gave the poor creatur some fresh water with which if i would have let him he would have burst himself after thi i went on board but the first sight i met with wa two men drown in the cook room or forecastl of the ship with their arm fast about on anoth i conclud as is inde probabl that when the ship struck it be in a storm the sea broke so high and so continu over her that the men were not abl to bear it and were strangl with the constant rush in of the water as much as if thei had been under water besid the dog there wa noth left in the ship that had life nor ani good that i could see but what were spoil by the water there were some cask of liquor whether wine or brandi i knew not which lai lower in the hold and which the water be eb out i could see but thei were too big to meddl with i saw sever chest which i believ belong to some of the seamen and i got two of them into the boat without examin what wa in them had the stern of the ship been fix and the forepart broken off i am persuad i might have made a good voyag for by what i found in those two chest i had room to suppos the ship had a great deal of wealth on board and if i mai guess from the cours she steer she must have been bound from bueno ayr or the rio de la plata in the south part of america beyond the brazil to the havannah in the gulf of mexico and so perhap to spain she had no doubt a great treasur in her but of no us at that time to anybodi and what becam of the crew i then knew not i found besid these chest a littl cask full of liquor of about twenti gallon which i got into my boat with much difficulti there were sever musket in the cabin and a great powder horn with about four pound of powder in it as for the musket i had no occas for them so i left them but took the powder horn i took a fire shovel and tong which i want extrem as also two littl brass kettl a copper pot to make chocol and a gridiron and with thi cargo and the dog i came awai the tide begin to make home again and the same even about an hour within night i reach the island again weari and fatigu to the last degre i repos that night in the boat and in the morn i resolv to harbour what i had got in my new cave and not carri it home to my castl after refresh myself i got all my cargo on shore and began to examin the particular the cask of liquor i found to be a kind of rum but not such as we had at the brazil and in a word not at all good but when i came to open the chest i found sever thing of great us to me for exampl i found in on a fine case of bottl of an extraordinari kind and fill with cordial water fine and veri good the bottl held about three pint each and were tip with silver i found two pot of veri good succad or sweetmeat so fasten also on the top that the salt water had not hurt them and two more of the same which the water had spoil i found some veri good shirt which were veri welcom to me and about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchief and colour neckcloth the former were also veri welcom be exceedingli refresh to wipe my face in a hot dai besid thi when i came to the till in the chest i found there three great bag of piec of eight which held about eleven hundr piec in all and in on of them wrap up in a paper six doubloon of gold and some small bar or wedg of gold i suppos thei might all weigh near a pound in the other chest were some cloth but of littl valu but by the circumst it must have belong to the gunner s mate though there wa no powder in it except two pound of fine glaze powder in three flask kept i suppos for charg their fowl piec on occas upon the whole i got veri littl by thi voyag that wa of ani us to me for as to the monei i had no manner of occas for it it wa to me as the dirt under my feet and i would have given it all for three or four pair of english shoe and stock which were thing i greatli want but had had none on my feet for mani year i had inde got two pair of shoe now which i took off the feet of two drown men whom i saw in the wreck and i found two pair more in on of the chest which were veri welcom to me but thei were not like our english shoe either for eas or servic be rather what we call pump than shoe i found in thi seaman s chest about fifti piec of eight in rial but no gold i suppos thi belong to a poorer man than the other which seem to belong to some offic well howev i lug thi monei home to my cave and laid it up as i had done that befor which i had brought from our own ship but it wa a great piti as i said that the other part of thi ship had not come to my share for i am satisfi i might have load my cano sever time over with monei and thought i if i ever escap to england it might lie here safe enough till i come again and fetch it chapter xiv a dream realis have now brought all my thing on shore and secur them i went back to my boat and row or paddl her along the shore to her old harbour where i laid her up and made the best of my wai to my old habit where i found everyth safe and quiet i began now to repos myself live after my old fashion and take care of my famili affair and for a while i live easi enough onli that i wa more vigil than i us to be look out often and did not go abroad so much and if at ani time i did stir with ani freedom it wa alwai to the east part of the island where i wa pretti well satisfi the savag never came and where i could go without so mani precaut and such a load of arm and ammunit as i alwai carri with me if i went the other wai i live in thi condit near two year more but my unlucki head that wa alwai to let me know it wa born to make my bodi miser wa all these two year fill with project and design how if it were possibl i might get awai from thi island for sometim i wa for make anoth voyag to the wreck though my reason told me that there wa noth left there worth the hazard of my voyag sometim for a rambl on wai sometim anoth and i believ verili if i had had the boat that i went from salle in i should have ventur to sea bound anywher i knew not whither i have been in all my circumst a memento to those who ar touch with the gener plagu of mankind whenc for aught i know on half of their miseri flow i mean that of not be satisfi with the station wherein god and natur hath place them for not to look back upon my primit condit and the excel advic of my father the opposit to which wa as i mai call it my origin sin my subsequ mistak of the same kind had been the mean of my come into thi miser condit for had that provid which so happili seat me at the brazil as a planter bless me with confin desir and i could have been content to have gone on gradual i might have been by thi time i mean in the time of my be in thi island on of the most consider planter in the brazil nai i am persuad that by the improv i had made in that littl time i live there and the increas i should probabl have made if i had remain i might have been worth a hundr thousand moidor and what busi had i to leav a settl fortun a well stock plantat improv and increas to turn supercargo to guinea to fetch negro when patienc and time would have so increas our stock at home that we could have bought them at our own door from those whose busi it wa to fetch them and though it had cost us someth more yet the differ of that price wa by no mean worth save at so great a hazard but as thi is usual the fate of young head so reflect upon the folli of it is as commonli the exercis of more year or of the dear bought experi of time so it wa with me now and yet so deep had the mistak taken root in my temper that i could not satisfi myself in my station but wa continu pore upon the mean and possibl of my escap from thi place and that i mai with greater pleasur to the reader bring on the remain part of my stori it mai not be improp to give some account of my first concept on the subject of thi foolish scheme for my escap and how and upon what foundat i act i am now to be suppos retir into my castl after my late voyag to the wreck my frigat laid up and secur under water as usual and my condit restor to what it wa befor i had more wealth inde than i had befor but wa not at all the richer for i had no more us for it than the indian of peru had befor the spaniard came there it wa on of the night in the raini season in march the four and twentieth year of my first set foot in thi island of solitud i wa ly in my bed or hammock awak veri well in health had no pain no distemp no uneasi of bodi nor ani uneasi of mind more than ordinari but could by no mean close my ey that is so as to sleep no not a wink all night long otherwis than as follow it is imposs to set down the innumer crowd of thought that whirl through that great thoroughfar of the brain the memori in thi night s time i ran over the whole histori of my life in miniatur or by abridg as i mai call it to my come to thi island and also of that part of my life sinc i came to thi island in my reflect upon the state of my case sinc i came on shore on thi island i wa compar the happi postur of my affair in the first year of my habit here with the life of anxieti fear and care which i had live in ever sinc i had seen the print of a foot in the sand not that i did not believ the savag had frequent the island even all the while and might have been sever hundr of them at time on shore there but i had never known it and wa incap of ani apprehens about it my satisfact wa perfect though my danger wa the same and i wa as happi in not know my danger as if i had never realli been expos to it thi furnish my thought with mani veri profit reflect and particularli thi on how infinit good that provid is which ha provid in it govern of mankind such narrow bound to hi sight and knowledg of thing and though he walk in the midst of so mani thousand danger the sight of which if discov to him would distract hi mind and sink hi spirit he is kept seren and calm by have the event of thing hid from hi ey and know noth of the danger which surround him after these thought had for some time entertain me i came to reflect serious upon the real danger i had been in for so mani year in thi veri island and how i had walk about in the greatest secur and with all possibl tranquil even when perhap noth but the brow of a hill a great tree or the casual approach of night had been between me and the worst kind of destruct viz that of fall into the hand of cannib and savag who would have seiz on me with the same view as i would on a goat or turtl and have thought it no more crime to kill and devour me than i did of a pigeon or a curlew i would unjustli slander myself if i should sai i wa not sincer thank to my great preserv to whose singular protect i acknowledg with great human all these unknown deliver were due and without which i must inevit have fallen into their merciless hand when these thought were over my head wa for some time taken up in consid the natur of these wretch creatur i mean the savag and how it came to pass in the world that the wise governor of all thing should give up ani of hi creatur to such inhuman nai to someth so much below even brutal itself as to devour it own kind but as thi end in some at that time fruitless specul it occur to me to inquir what part of the world these wretch live in how far off the coast wa from whenc thei came what thei ventur over so far from home for what kind of boat thei had and why i might not order myself and my busi so that i might be abl to go over thither as thei were to come to me i never so much as troubl myself to consid what i should do with myself when i went thither what would becom of me if i fell into the hand of these savag or how i should escap them if thei attack me no nor so much as how it wa possibl for me to reach the coast and not to be attack by some or other of them without ani possibl of deliv myself and if i should not fall into their hand what i should do for provis or whither i should bend my cours none of these thought i sai so much as came in my wai but my mind wa wholli bent upon the notion of my pass over in my boat to the mainland i look upon my present condit as the most miser that could possibl be that i wa not abl to throw myself into anyth but death that could be call wors and if i reach the shore of the main i might perhap meet with relief or i might coast along as i did on the african shore till i came to some inhabit countri and where i might find some relief and after all perhap i might fall in with some christian ship that might take me in and if the worst came to the worst i could but die which would put an end to all these miseri at onc prai note all thi wa the fruit of a disturb mind an impati temper made desper as it were by the long continu of my troubl and the disappoint i had met in the wreck i had been on board of and where i had been so near obtain what i so earnestli long for somebodi to speak to and to learn some knowledg from them of the place where i wa and of the probabl mean of my deliver i wa agit wholli by these thought all my calm of mind in my resign to provid and wait the issu of the disposit of heaven seem to be suspend and i had as it were no power to turn my thought to anyth but to the project of a voyag to the main which came upon me with such forc and such an impetuos of desir that it wa not to be resist when thi had agit my thought for two hour or more with such violenc that it set my veri blood into a ferment and my puls beat as if i had been in a fever mere with the extraordinari fervour of my mind about it natur as if i had been fatigu and exhaust with the veri thought of it threw me into a sound sleep on would have thought i should have dream of it but i did not nor of anyth relat to it but i dream that as i wa go out in the morn as usual from my castl i saw upon the shore two cano and eleven savag come to land and that thei brought with them anoth savag whom thei were go to kill in order to eat him when on a sudden the savag that thei were go to kill jump awai and ran for hi life and i thought in my sleep that he came run into my littl thick grove befor my fortif to hide himself and that i see him alon and not perceiv that the other sought him that wai show myself to him and smile upon him encourag him that he kneel down to me seem to prai me to assist him upon which i show him my ladder made him go up and carri him into my cave and he becam my servant and that as soon as i had got thi man i said to myself now i mai certainli ventur to the mainland for thi fellow will serv me as a pilot and will tell me what to do and whither to go for provis and whither not to go for fear of be devour what place to ventur into and what to shun i wake with thi thought and wa under such inexpress impress of joi at the prospect of my escap in my dream that the disappoint which i felt upon come to myself and find that it wa no more than a dream were equal extravag the other wai and threw me into a veri great deject of spirit upon thi howev i made thi conclus that my onli wai to go about to attempt an escap wa to endeavour to get a savag into my possess and if possibl it should be on of their prison whom thei had condemn to be eaten and should bring hither to kill but these thought still were attend with thi difficulti that it wa imposs to effect thi without attack a whole caravan of them and kill them all and thi wa not onli a veri desper attempt and might miscarri but on the other hand i had greatli scrupl the law of it to myself and my heart trembl at the thought of shed so much blood though it wa for my deliver i need not repeat the argument which occur to me against thi thei be the same mention befor but though i had other reason to offer now viz that those men were enemi to my life and would devour me if thei could that it wa self preserv in the highest degre to deliv myself from thi death of a life and wa act in my own defenc as much as if thei were actual assault me and the like i sai though these thing argu for it yet the thought of shed human blood for my deliver were veri terribl to me and such as i could by no mean reconcil myself to for a great while howev at last after mani secret disput with myself and after great perplex about it for all these argument on wai and anoth struggl in my head a long time the eager prevail desir of deliver at length master all the rest and i resolv if possibl to get on of these savag into my hand cost what it would my next thing wa to contriv how to do it and thi inde wa veri difficult to resolv on but as i could pitch upon no probabl mean for it so i resolv to put myself upon the watch to see them when thei came on shore and leav the rest to the event take such measur as the opportun should present let what would be with these resolut in my thought i set myself upon the scout as often as possibl and inde so often that i wa heartili tire of it for it wa abov a year and a half that i wait and for great part of that time went out to the west end and to the south west corner of the island almost everi dai to look for cano but none appear thi wa veri discourag and began to troubl me much though i cannot sai that it did in thi case as it had done some time befor wear off the edg of my desir to the thing but the longer it seem to be delai the more eager i wa for it in a word i wa not at first so care to shun the sight of these savag and avoid be seen by them as i wa now eager to be upon them besid i fanci myself abl to manag on nai two or three savag if i had them so as to make them entir slave to me to do whatev i should direct them and to prevent their be abl at ani time to do me ani hurt it wa a great while that i pleas myself with thi affair but noth still present itself all my fanci and scheme came to noth for no savag came near me for a great while about a year and a half after i entertain these notion and by long muse had as it were resolv them all into noth for want of an occas to put them into execut i wa surpris on morn by see no less than five cano all on shore togeth on my side the island and the peopl who belong to them all land and out of my sight the number of them broke all my measur for see so mani and know that thei alwai came four or six or sometim more in a boat i could not tell what to think of it or how to take my measur to attack twenti or thirti men singl hand so lai still in my castl perplex and discomfort howev i put myself into the same posit for an attack that i had formerli provid and wa just readi for action if anyth had present have wait a good while listen to hear if thei made ani nois at length be veri impati i set my gun at the foot of my ladder and clamber up to the top of the hill by my two stage as usual stand so howev that my head did not appear abov the hill so that thei could not perceiv me by ani mean here i observ by the help of my perspect glass that thei were no less than thirti in number that thei had a fire kindl and that thei had meat dress how thei had cook it i knew not or what it wa but thei were all danc in i know not how mani barbar gestur and figur their own wai round the fire while i wa thu look on them i perceiv by my perspect two miser wretch drag from the boat where it seem thei were laid by and were now brought out for the slaughter i perceiv on of them immedi fall be knock down i suppos with a club or wooden sword for that wa their wai and two or three other were at work immedi cut him open for their cookeri while the other victim wa left stand by himself till thei should be readi for him in that veri moment thi poor wretch see himself a littl at liberti and unbound natur inspir him with hope of life and he start awai from them and ran with incred swift along the sand directli toward me i mean toward that part of the coast where my habit wa i wa dreadfulli frighten i must acknowledg when i perceiv him run my wai and especi when as i thought i saw him pursu by the whole bodi and now i expect that part of my dream wa come to pass and that he would certainli take shelter in my grove but i could not depend by ani mean upon my dream that the other savag would not pursu him thither and find him there howev i kept my station and my spirit began to recov when i found that there wa not abov three men that follow him and still more wa i encourag when i found that he outstrip them exceedingli in run and gain ground on them so that if he could but hold out for half an hour i saw easili he would fairli get awai from them all there wa between them and my castl the creek which i mention often in the first part of my stori where i land my cargo out of the ship and thi i saw plainli he must necessarili swim over or the poor wretch would be taken there but when the savag escap came thither he made noth of it though the tide wa then up but plung in swam through in about thirti stroke or thereabout land and ran with exceed strength and swift when the three person came to the creek i found that two of them could swim but the third could not and that stand on the other side he look at the other but went no farther and soon after went softli back again which as it happen wa veri well for him in the end i observ that the two who swam were yet more than twice as strong swim over the creek as the fellow wa that fled from them it came veri warmli upon my thought and inde irresist that now wa the time to get me a servant and perhap a companion or assist and that i wa plainli call by provid to save thi poor creatur s life i immedi ran down the ladder with all possibl expedit fetch my two gun for thei were both at the foot of the ladder as i observ befor and get up again with the same hast to the top of the hill i cross toward the sea and have a veri short cut and all down hill place myself in the wai between the pursuer and the pursu hallow aloud to him that fled who look back wa at first perhap as much frighten at me as at them but i beckon with my hand to him to come back and in the meantim i slowli advanc toward the two that follow then rush at onc upon the foremost i knock him down with the stock of my piec i wa loath to fire becaus i would not have the rest hear though at that distanc it would not have been easili heard and be out of sight of the smoke too thei would not have known what to make of it have knock thi fellow down the other who pursu him stop as if he had been frighten and i advanc toward him but as i came nearer i perceiv present he had a bow and arrow and wa fit it to shoot at me so i wa then oblig to shoot at him first which i did and kill him at the first shot the poor savag who fled but had stop though he saw both hi enemi fallen and kill as he thought yet wa so frighten with the fire and nois of my piec that he stood stock still and neither came forward nor went backward though he seem rather inclin still to fly than to come on i halloo again to him and made sign to come forward which he easili understood and came a littl wai then stop again and then a littl farther and stop again and i could then perceiv that he stood trembl as if he had been taken prison and had just been to be kill as hi two enemi were i beckon to him again to come to me and gave him all the sign of encourag that i could think of and he came nearer and nearer kneel down everi ten or twelv step in token of acknowledg for save hi life i smile at him and look pleasantli and beckon to him to come still nearer at length he came close to me and then he kneel down again kiss the ground and laid hi head upon the ground and take me by the foot set my foot upon hi head thi it seem wa in token of swear to be my slave for ever i took him up and made much of him and encourag him all i could but there wa more work to do yet for i perceiv the savag whom i had knock down wa not kill but stun with the blow and began to come to himself so i point to him and show him the savag that he wa not dead upon thi he spoke some word to me and though i could not understand them yet i thought thei were pleasant to hear for thei were the first sound of a man s voic that i had heard my own except for abov twenti five year but there wa no time for such reflect now the savag who wa knock down recov himself so far as to sit up upon the ground and i perceiv that my savag began to be afraid but when i saw that i present my other piec at the man as if i would shoot him upon thi my savag for so i call him now made a motion to me to lend him my sword which hung nake in a belt by my side which i did he no sooner had it but he run to hi enemi and at on blow cut off hi head so cleverli no execution in germani could have done it sooner or better which i thought veri strang for on who i had reason to believ never saw a sword in hi life befor except their own wooden sword howev it seem as i learn afterward thei make their wooden sword so sharp so heavi and the wood is so hard that thei will even cut off head with them ay and arm and that at on blow too when he had done thi he come laugh to me in sign of triumph and brought me the sword again and with abund of gestur which i did not understand laid it down with the head of the savag that he had kill just befor me but that which astonish him most wa to know how i kill the other indian so far off so point to him he made sign to me to let him go to him and i bade him go as well as i could when he came to him he stood like on amaz look at him turn him first on on side then on the other look at the wound the bullet had made which it seem wa just in hi breast where it had made a hole and no great quantiti of blood had follow but he had bled inwardli for he wa quit dead he took up hi bow and arrow and came back so i turn to go awai and beckon him to follow me make sign to him that more might come after them upon thi he made sign to me that he should buri them with sand that thei might not be seen by the rest if thei follow and so i made sign to him again to do so he fell to work and in an instant he had scrape a hole in the sand with hi hand big enough to buri the first in and then drag him into it and cover him and did so by the other also i believ he had him buri them both in a quarter of an hour then call awai i carri him not to my castl but quit awai to my cave on the farther part of the island so i did not let my dream come to pass in that part that he came into my grove for shelter here i gave him bread and a bunch of raisin to eat and a draught of water which i found he wa inde in great distress for from hi run and have refresh him i made sign for him to go and lie down to sleep show him a place where i had laid some rice straw and a blanket upon it which i us to sleep upon myself sometim so the poor creatur lai down and went to sleep he wa a come handsom fellow perfectli well made with straight strong limb not too larg tall and well shape and as i reckon about twenti six year of ag he had a veri good counten not a fierc and surli aspect but seem to have someth veri manli in hi face and yet he had all the sweet and soft of a european in hi counten too especi when he smile hi hair wa long and black not curl like wool hi forehead veri high and larg and a great vivac and sparkl sharp in hi ey the colour of hi skin wa not quit black but veri tawni and yet not an ugli yellow nauseou tawni as the brazilian and virginian and other nativ of america ar but of a bright kind of a dun oliv colour that had in it someth veri agreeabl though not veri easi to describ hi face wa round and plump hi nose small not flat like the negro a veri good mouth thin lip and hi fine teeth well set and as white as ivori after he had slumber rather than slept about half an hour he awok again and came out of the cave to me for i had been milk my goat which i had in the enclosur just by when he espi me he came run to me lai himself down again upon the ground with all the possibl sign of an humbl thank disposit make a great mani antic gestur to show it at last he lai hi head flat upon the ground close to my foot and set my other foot upon hi head as he had done befor and after thi made all the sign to me of subject servitud and submiss imagin to let me know how he would serv me so long as he live i understood him in mani thing and let him know i wa veri well pleas with him in a littl time i began to speak to him and teach him to speak to me and first i let him know hi name should be fridai which wa the dai i save hi life i call him so for the memori of the time i likewis taught him to sai master and then let him know that wa to be my name i likewis taught him to sai ye and no and to know the mean of them i gave him some milk in an earthen pot and let him see me drink it befor him and sop my bread in it and gave him a cake of bread to do the like which he quickli compli with and made sign that it wa veri good for him i kept there with him all that night but as soon as it wa dai i beckon to him to come with me and let him know i would give him some cloth at which he seem veri glad for he wa stark nake as we went by the place where he had buri the two men he point exactli to the place and show me the mark that he had made to find them again make sign to me that we should dig them up again and eat them at thi i appear veri angri express my abhorr of it made as if i would vomit at the thought of it and beckon with my hand to him to come awai which he did immedi with great submiss i then led him up to the top of the hill to see if hi enemi were gone and pull out my glass i look and saw plainli the place where thei had been but no appear of them or their cano so that it wa plain thei were gone and had left their two comrad behind them without ani search after them but i wa not content with thi discoveri but have now more courag and consequ more curios i took my man fridai with me give him the sword in hi hand with the bow and arrow at hi back which i found he could us veri dexter make him carri on gun for me and i two for myself and awai we march to the place where these creatur had been for i had a mind now to get some further intellig of them when i came to the place my veri blood ran chill in my vein and my heart sunk within me at the horror of the spectacl inde it wa a dread sight at least it wa so to me though fridai made noth of it the place wa cover with human bone the ground dy with their blood and great piec of flesh left here and there half eaten mangl and scorch and in short all the token of the triumphant feast thei had been make there after a victori over their enemi i saw three skull five hand and the bone of three or four leg and feet and abund of other part of the bodi and fridai by hi sign made me understand that thei brought over four prison to feast upon that three of them were eaten up and that he point to himself wa the fourth that there had been a great battl between them and their next king of whose subject it seem he had been on and that thei had taken a great number of prison all which were carri to sever place by those who had taken them in the fight in order to feast upon them as wa done here by these wretch upon those thei brought hither i caus fridai to gather all the skull bone flesh and whatev remain and lai them togeth in a heap and make a great fire upon it and burn them all to ash i found fridai had still a hanker stomach after some of the flesh and wa still a cannib in hi natur but i show so much abhorr at the veri thought of it and at the least appear of it that he durst not discov it for i had by some mean let him know that i would kill him if he offer it when he had done thi we came back to our castl and there i fell to work for my man fridai and first of all i gave him a pair of linen drawer which i had out of the poor gunner s chest i mention which i found in the wreck and which with a littl alter fit him veri well and then i made him a jerkin of goat s skin as well as my skill would allow for i wa now grown a toler good tailor and i gave him a cap which i made of hare s skin veri conveni and fashion enough and thu he wa cloth for the present toler well and wa mighti well pleas to see himself almost as well cloth as hi master it is true he went awkwardli in these cloth at first wear the drawer wa veri awkward to him and the sleev of the waistcoat gall hi shoulder and the insid of hi arm but a littl eas them where he complain thei hurt him and us himself to them he took to them at length veri well the next dai after i came home to my hutch with him i began to consid where i should lodg him and that i might do well for him and yet be perfectli easi myself i made a littl tent for him in the vacant place between my two fortif in the insid of the last and in the outsid of the first as there wa a door or entranc there into my cave i made a formal frame door case and a door to it of board and set it up in the passag a littl within the entranc and caus the door to open in the insid i bar it up in the night take in my ladder too so that fridai could no wai come at me in the insid of my innermost wall without make so much nois in get over that it must need awaken me for my first wall had now a complet roof over it of long pole cover all my tent and lean up to the side of the hill which wa again laid across with smaller stick instead of lath and then thatch over a great thick with the rice straw which wa strong like reed and at the hole or place which wa left to go in or out by the ladder i had place a kind of trap door which if it had been attempt on the outsid would not have open at all but would have fallen down and made a great nois as to weapon i took them all into my side everi night but i need none of all thi precaut for never man had a more faith love sincer servant than fridai wa to me without passion sullen or design perfectli oblig and engag hi veri affect were ti to me like those of a child to a father and i daresai he would have sacrif hi life to save mine upon ani occas whatsoev the mani testimoni he gave me of thi put it out of doubt and soon convinc me that i need to us no precaut for my safeti on hi account thi frequent gave me occas to observ and that with wonder that howev it had pleas god in hi provid and in the govern of the work of hi hand to take from so great a part of the world of hi creatur the best us to which their faculti and the power of their soul ar adapt yet that he ha bestow upon them the same power the same reason the same affect the same sentiment of kind and oblig the same passion and resent of wrong the same sens of gratitud sincer fidel and all the capac of do good and receiv good that he ha given to us and that when he pleas to offer them occas of exert these thei ar as readi nai more readi to appli them to the right us for which thei were bestow than we ar thi made me veri melancholi sometim in reflect as the sever occas present how mean a us we make of all these even though we have these power enlighten by the great lamp of instruct the spirit of god and by the knowledg of hi word ad to our understand and why it ha pleas god to hide the like save knowledg from so mani million of soul who if i might judg by thi poor savag would make a much better us of it than we did from henc i sometim wa led too far to invad the sovereignti of provid and as it were arraign the justic of so arbitrari a disposit of thing that should hide that sight from some and reveal it to other and yet expect a like duti from both but i shut it up and check my thought with thi conclus first that we did not know by what light and law these should be condemn but that as god wa necessarili and by the natur of hi be infinit holi and just so it could not be but if these creatur were all sentenc to absenc from himself it wa on account of sin against that light which as the scriptur sai wa a law to themselv and by such rule as their conscienc would acknowledg to be just though the foundat wa not discov to us and secondli that still as we all ar the clai in the hand of the potter no vessel could sai to him why hast thou form me thu but to return to my new companion i wa greatli delight with him and made it my busi to teach him everyth that wa proper to make him us handi and help but especi to make him speak and understand me when i spoke and he wa the aptest scholar that ever wa and particularli wa so merri so constantli dilig and so pleas when he could but understand me or make me understand him that it wa veri pleasant for me to talk to him now my life began to be so easi that i began to sai to myself that could i but have been safe from more savag i care not if i wa never to remov from the place where i live chapter xv fridai s educ after i had been two or three dai return to my castl i thought that in order to bring fridai off from hi horrid wai of feed and from the relish of a cannib s stomach i ought to let him tast other flesh so i took him out with me on morn to the wood i went inde intend to kill a kid out of my own flock and bring it home and dress it but as i wa go i saw a she goat ly down in the shade and two young kid sit by her i catch hold of fridai hold said i stand still and made sign to him not to stir immedi i present my piec shot and kill on of the kid the poor creatur who had at a distanc inde seen me kill the savag hi enemi but did not know nor could imagin how it wa done wa sensibl surpris trembl and shook and look so amaz that i thought he would have sunk down he did not see the kid i shot at or perceiv i had kill it but rip up hi waistcoat to feel whether he wa not wound and as i found present thought i wa resolv to kill him for he came and kneel down to me and embrac my knee said a great mani thing i did not understand but i could easili see the mean wa to prai me not to kill him i soon found a wai to convinc him that i would do him no harm and take him up by the hand laugh at him and point to the kid which i had kill beckon to him to run and fetch it which he did and while he wa wonder and look to see how the creatur wa kill i load my gun again by and by i saw a great fowl like a hawk sit upon a tree within shot so to let fridai understand a littl what i would do i call him to me again point at the fowl which wa inde a parrot though i thought it had been a hawk i sai point to the parrot and to my gun and to the ground under the parrot to let him see i would make it fall i made him understand that i would shoot and kill that bird accordingli i fire and bade him look and immedi he saw the parrot fall he stood like on frighten again notwithstand all i had said to him and i found he wa the more amaz becaus he did not see me put anyth into the gun but thought that there must be some wonder fund of death and destruct in that thing abl to kill man beast bird or anyth near or far off and the astonish thi creat in him wa such as could not wear off for a long time and i believ if i would have let him he would have worship me and my gun as for the gun itself he would not so much as touch it for sever dai after but he would speak to it and talk to it as if it had answer him when he wa by himself which as i afterward learn of him wa to desir it not to kill him well after hi astonish wa a littl over at thi i point to him to run and fetch the bird i had shot which he did but stai some time for the parrot not be quit dead had flutter awai a good distanc from the place where she fell howev he found her took her up and brought her to me and as i had perceiv hi ignor about the gun befor i took thi advantag to charg the gun again and not to let him see me do it that i might be readi for ani other mark that might present but noth more offer at that time so i brought home the kid and the same even i took the skin off and cut it out as well as i could and have a pot fit for that purpos i boil or stew some of the flesh and made some veri good broth after i had begun to eat some i gave some to my man who seem veri glad of it and like it veri well but that which wa strangest to him wa to see me eat salt with it he made a sign to me that the salt wa not good to eat and put a littl into hi own mouth he seem to nauseat it and would spit and sputter at it wash hi mouth with fresh water after it on the other hand i took some meat into my mouth without salt and i pretend to spit and sputter for want of salt as much as he had done at the salt but it would not do he would never care for salt with meat or in hi broth at least not for a great while and then but a veri littl have thu fed him with boil meat and broth i wa resolv to feast him the next dai by roast a piec of the kid thi i did by hang it befor the fire on a string as i had seen mani peopl do in england set two pole up on on each side of the fire and on across the top and ty the string to the cross stick let the meat turn continu thi fridai admir veri much but when he came to tast the flesh he took so mani wai to tell me how well he like it that i could not but understand him and at last he told me as well as he could he would never eat man s flesh ani more which i wa veri glad to hear the next dai i set him to work beat some corn out and sift it in the manner i us to do as i observ befor and he soon understood how to do it as well as i especi after he had seen what the mean of it wa and that it wa to make bread of for after that i let him see me make my bread and bake it too and in a littl time fridai wa abl to do all the work for me as well as i could do it myself i began now to consid that have two mouth to feed instead of on i must provid more ground for my harvest and plant a larger quantiti of corn than i us to do so i mark out a larger piec of land and began the fenc in the same manner as befor in which fridai work not onli veri willingli and veri hard but did it veri cheerfulli and i told him what it wa for that it wa for corn to make more bread becaus he wa now with me and that i might have enough for him and myself too he appear veri sensibl of that part and let me know that he thought i had much more labour upon me on hi account than i had for myself and that he would work the harder for me if i would tell him what to do thi wa the pleasantest year of all the life i led in thi place fridai began to talk pretti well and understand the name of almost everyth i had occas to call for and of everi place i had to send him to and talk a great deal to me so that in short i began now to have some us for my tongu again which inde i had veri littl occas for befor besid the pleasur of talk to him i had a singular satisfact in the fellow himself hi simpl unfeign honesti appear to me more and more everi dai and i began realli to love the creatur and on hi side i believ he love me more than it wa possibl for him ever to love anyth befor i had a mind onc to try if he had ani inclin for hi own countri again and have taught him english so well that he could answer me almost ani question i ask him whether the nation that he belong to never conquer in battl at which he smile and said ye ye we alwai fight the better that is he meant alwai get the better in fight and so we began the follow discours master you alwai fight the better how came you to be taken prison then fridai fridai my nation beat much for all that master how beat if your nation beat them how came you to be taken fridai thei more mani than my nation in the place where me wa thei take on two three and me my nation over beat them in the yonder place where me no wa there my nation take on two great thousand master but why did not your side recov you from the hand of your enemi then fridai thei run on two three and me and make go in the cano my nation have no cano that time master well fridai and what doe your nation do with the men thei take do thei carri them awai and eat them as these did fridai ye my nation eat man too eat all up master where do thei carri them fridai go to other place where thei think master do thei come hither fridai ye ye thei come hither come other els place master have you been here with them fridai ye i have been here point to the nw side of the island which it seem wa their side by thi i understood that my man fridai had formerli been among the savag who us to come on shore on the farther part of the island on the same man eat occas he wa now brought for and some time after when i took the courag to carri him to that side be the same i formerli mention he present knew the place and told me he wa there onc when thei at up twenti men two women and on child he could not tell twenti in english but he number them by lai so mani stone in a row and point to me to tell them over i have told thi passag becaus it introduc what follow that after thi discours i had with him i ask him how far it wa from our island to the shore and whether the cano were not often lost he told me there wa no danger no cano ever lost but that after a littl wai out to sea there wa a current and wind alwai on wai in the morn the other in the afternoon thi i understood to be no more than the set of the tide as go out or come in but i afterward understood it wa occas by the great draft and reflux of the mighti river orinoco in the mouth or gulf of which river as i found afterward our island lai and that thi land which i perceiv to be w and nw wa the great island trinidad on the north point of the mouth of the river i ask fridai a thousand question about the countri the inhabit the sea the coast and what nation were near he told me all he knew with the greatest open imagin i ask him the name of the sever nation of hi sort of peopl but could get no other name than carib from whenc i easili understood that these were the caribbe which our map place on the part of america which reach from the mouth of the river orinoco to guiana and onward to st martha he told me that up a great wai beyond the moon that wa beyond the set of the moon which must be west from their countri there dwelt white beard men like me and point to my great whisker which i mention befor and that thei had kill much man that wa hi word by all which i understood he meant the spaniard whose cruelti in america had been spread over the whole countri and were rememb by all the nation from father to son i inquir if he could tell me how i might go from thi island and get among those white men he told me ye ye you mai go in two cano i could not understand what he meant or make him describ to me what he meant by two cano till at last with great difficulti i found he meant it must be in a larg boat as big as two cano thi part of fridai s discours i began to relish veri well and from thi time i entertain some hope that on time or other i might find an opportun to make my escap from thi place and that thi poor savag might be a mean to help me dure the long time that fridai had now been with me and that he began to speak to me and understand me i wa not want to lai a foundat of religi knowledg in hi mind particularli i ask him on time who made him the creatur did not understand me at all but thought i had ask who wa hi father but i took it up by anoth handl and ask him who made the sea the ground we walk on and the hill and wood he told me it wa on benamucke that live beyond all he could describ noth of thi great person but that he wa veri old much older he said than the sea or land than the moon or the star i ask him then if thi old person had made all thing why did not all thing worship him he look veri grave and with a perfect look of innoc said all thing sai o to him i ask him if the peopl who die in hi countri went awai anywher he said ye thei all went to benamucke then i ask him whether those thei eat up went thither too he said ye from these thing i began to instruct him in the knowledg of the true god i told him that the great maker of all thing live up there point up toward heaven that he govern the world by the same power and provid by which he made it that he wa omnipot and could do everyth for us give everyth to us take everyth from us and thu by degre i open hi ey he listen with great attent and receiv with pleasur the notion of jesu christ be sent to redeem us and of the manner of make our prayer to god and hi be abl to hear us even in heaven he told me on dai that if our god could hear us up beyond the sun he must need be a greater god than their benamucke who live but a littl wai off and yet could not hear till thei went up to the great mountain where he dwelt to speak to them i ask him if ever he went thither to speak to him he said no thei never went that were young men none went thither but the old men whom he call their oowokake that is as i made him explain to me their religi or clergi and that thei went to sai o so he call sai prayer and then came back and told them what benamucke said by thi i observ that there is priestcraft even among the most blind ignor pagan in the world and the polici of make a secret of religion in order to preserv the vener of the peopl to the clergi not onli to be found in the roman but perhap among all religion in the world even among the most brutish and barbar savag i endeavour to clear up thi fraud to my man fridai and told him that the pretenc of their old men go up to the mountain to sai o to their god benamucke wa a cheat and their bring word from thenc what he said wa much more so that if thei met with ani answer or spake with ani on there it must be with an evil spirit and then i enter into a long discours with him about the devil the origin of him hi rebellion against god hi enmiti to man the reason of it hi set himself up in the dark part of the world to be worship instead of god and as god and the mani stratagem he made us of to delud mankind to their ruin how he had a secret access to our passion and to our affect and to adapt hi snare to our inclin so as to caus us even to be our own tempter and run upon our destruct by our own choic i found it wa not so easi to imprint right notion in hi mind about the devil as it wa about the be of a god natur assist all my argument to evid to him even the necess of a great first caus an overrul govern power a secret direct provid and of the equiti and justic of pai homag to him that made us and the like but there appear noth of thi kind in the notion of an evil spirit of hi origin hi be hi natur and abov all of hi inclin to do evil and to draw us in to do so too and the poor creatur puzzl me onc in such a manner by a question mere natur and innoc that i scarc knew what to sai to him i had been talk a great deal to him of the power of god hi omnipot hi avers to sin hi be a consum fire to the worker of iniqu how as he had made us all he could destroi us and all the world in a moment and he listen with great serious to me all the while after thi i had been tell him how the devil wa god s enemi in the heart of men and us all hi malic and skill to defeat the good design of provid and to ruin the kingdom of christ in the world and the like well sai fridai but you sai god is so strong so great is he not much strong much might as the devil ye ye sai i fridai god is stronger than the devil god is abov the devil and therefor we prai to god to tread him down under our feet and enabl us to resist hi temptat and quench hi fieri dart but sai he again if god much stronger much might as the wick devil why god no kill the devil so make him no more do wick i wa strang surpris at thi question and after all though i wa now an old man yet i wa but a young doctor and ill qualifi for a casuist or a solver of difficulti and at first i could not tell what to sai so i pretend not to hear him and ask him what he said but he wa too earnest for an answer to forget hi question so that he repeat it in the veri same broken word as abov by thi time i had recov myself a littl and i said god will at last punish him sever he is reserv for the judgment and is to be cast into the bottomless pit to dwell with everlast fire thi did not satisfi fridai but he return upon me repeat my word reserv at last me no understand but why not kill the devil now not kill great ago you mai as well ask me said i why god doe not kill you or me when we do wick thing here that offend him we ar preserv to repent and be pardon he muse some time on thi well well sai he mighti affection that well so you i devil all wick all preserv repent god pardon all here i wa run down again by him to the last degre and it wa a testimoni to me how the mere notion of natur though thei will guid reason creatur to the knowledg of a god and of a worship or homag due to the suprem be of god as the consequ of our natur yet noth but divin revel can form the knowledg of jesu christ and of redempt purchas for us of a mediat of the new coven and of an intercessor at the footstool of god s throne i sai noth but a revel from heaven can form these in the soul and that therefor the gospel of our lord and saviour jesu christ i mean the word of god and the spirit of god promis for the guid and sanctifi of hi peopl ar the absolut necessari instructor of the soul of men in the save knowledg of god and the mean of salvat i therefor divert the present discours between me and my man rise up hastili as upon some sudden occas of go out then send him for someth a good wai off i serious prai to god that he would enabl me to instruct savingli thi poor savag assist by hi spirit the heart of the poor ignor creatur to receiv the light of the knowledg of god in christ reconcil him to himself and would guid me so to speak to him from the word of god that hi conscienc might be convinc hi ey open and hi soul save when he came again to me i enter into a long discours with him upon the subject of the redempt of man by the saviour of the world and of the doctrin of the gospel preach from heaven viz of repent toward god and faith in our bless lord jesu i then explain to him as well as i could why our bless redeem took not on him the natur of angel but the seed of abraham and how for that reason the fallen angel had no share in the redempt that he came onli to the lost sheep of the hous of israel and the like i had god know more sincer than knowledg in all the method i took for thi poor creatur s instruct and must acknowledg what i believ all that act upon the same principl will find that in lai thing open to him i realli inform and instruct myself in mani thing that either i did not know or had not fulli consid befor but which occur natur to my mind upon search into them for the inform of thi poor savag and i had more affect in my inquiri after thing upon thi occas than ever i felt befor so that whether thi poor wild wretch wa better for me or no i had great reason to be thank that ever he came to me my grief sat lighter upon me my habit grew comfort to me beyond measur and when i reflect that in thi solitari life which i have been confin to i had not onli been move to look up to heaven myself and to seek the hand that had brought me here but wa now to be made an instrument under provid to save the life and for aught i knew the soul of a poor savag and bring him to the true knowledg of religion and of the christian doctrin that he might know christ jesu in whom is life etern i sai when i reflect upon all these thing a secret joi ran through everi part of my soul and i frequent rejoic that ever i wa brought to thi place which i had so often thought the most dread of all afflict that could possibl have befallen me i continu in thi thank frame all the remaind of my time and the convers which emploi the hour between fridai and me wa such as made the three year which we live there togeth perfectli and complet happi if ani such thing as complet happi can be form in a sublunari state thi savag wa now a good christian a much better than i though i have reason to hope and bless god for it that we were equal penit and comfort restor penit we had here the word of god to read and no farther off from hi spirit to instruct than if we had been in england i alwai appli myself in read the scriptur to let him know as well as i could the mean of what i read and he again by hi seriou inquiri and question made me as i said befor a much better scholar in the scriptur knowledg than i should ever have been by my own mere privat read anoth thing i cannot refrain from observ here also from experi in thi retir part of my life viz how infinit and inexpress a bless it is that the knowledg of god and of the doctrin of salvat by christ jesu is so plainli laid down in the word of god so easi to be receiv and understood that as the bare read the scriptur made me capabl of understand enough of my duti to carri me directli on to the great work of sincer repent for my sin and lai hold of a saviour for life and salvat to a state reform in practic and obedi to all god s command and thi without ani teacher or instructor i mean human so the same plain instruct suffici serv to the enlighten thi savag creatur and bring him to be such a christian as i have known few equal to him in my life as to all the disput wrangl strife and content which have happen in the world about religion whether niceti in doctrin or scheme of church govern thei were all perfectli useless to us and for aught i can yet see thei have been so to the rest of the world we had the sure guid to heaven viz the word of god and we had bless be god comfort view of the spirit of god teach and instruct by hi word lead us into all truth and make us both will and obedi to the instruct of hi word and i cannot see the least us that the greatest knowledg of the disput point of religion which have made such confus in the world would have been to us if we could have obtain it but i must go on with the histor part of thing and take everi part in it order after fridai and i becam more intim acquaint and that he could understand almost all i said to him and speak pretti fluentli though in broken english to me i acquaint him with my own histori or at least so much of it as relat to my come to thi place how i had live there and how long i let him into the mysteri for such it wa to him of gunpowd and bullet and taught him how to shoot i gave him a knife which he wa wonderfulli delight with and i made him a belt with a frog hang to it such as in england we wear hanger in and in the frog instead of a hanger i gave him a hatchet which wa not onli as good a weapon in some case but much more us upon other occas i describ to him the countri of europ particularli england which i came from how we live how we worship god how we behav to on anoth and how we trade in ship to all part of the world i gave him an account of the wreck which i had been on board of and show him as near as i could the place where she lai but she wa all beaten in piec befor and gone i show him the ruin of our boat which we lost when we escap and which i could not stir with my whole strength then but wa now fallen almost all to piec upon see thi boat fridai stood muse a great while and said noth i ask him what it wa he studi upon at last sai he me see such boat like come to place at my nation i did not understand him a good while but at last when i had examin further into it i understood by him that a boat such as that had been came on shore upon the countri where he live that is as he explain it wa driven thither by stress of weather i present imagin that some european ship must have been cast awai upon their coast and the boat might get loos and drive ashor but wa so dull that i never onc thought of men make their escap from a wreck thither much less whenc thei might come so i onli inquir after a descript of the boat fridai describ the boat to me well enough but brought me better to understand him when he ad with some warmth we save the white man from drown then i present ask if there were ani white man as he call them in the boat ye he said the boat full of white man i ask him how mani he told upon hi finger seventeen i ask him then what becam of them he told me thei live thei dwell at my nation thi put new thought into my head for i present imagin that these might be the men belong to the ship that wa cast awai in the sight of my island as i now call it and who after the ship wa struck on the rock and thei saw her inevit lost had save themselv in their boat and were land upon that wild shore among the savag upon thi i inquir of him more critic what wa becom of them he assur me thei live still there that thei had been there about four year that the savag left them alon and gave them victual to live on i ask him how it came to pass thei did not kill them and eat them he said no thei make brother with them that is as i understood him a truce and then he ad thei no eat man but when make the war fight that is to sai thei never eat ani men but such as come to fight with them and ar taken in battl it wa after thi some consider time that be upon the top of the hill at the east side of the island from whenc as i have said i had in a clear dai discov the main or contin of america fridai the weather be veri seren look veri earnestli toward the mainland and in a kind of surpris fall a jump and danc and call out to me for i wa at some distanc from him i ask him what wa the matter oh joi sai he oh glad there see my countri there my nation i observ an extraordinari sens of pleasur appear in hi face and hi ey sparkl and hi counten discov a strang eager as if he had a mind to be in hi own countri again thi observ of mine put a great mani thought into me which made me at first not so easi about my new man fridai as i wa befor and i made no doubt but that if fridai could get back to hi own nation again he would not onli forget all hi religion but all hi oblig to me and would be forward enough to give hi countrymen an account of me and come back perhap with a hundr or two of them and make a feast upon me at which he might be as merri as he us to be with those of hi enemi when thei were taken in war but i wrong the poor honest creatur veri much for which i wa veri sorri afterward howev as my jealousi increas and held some week i wa a littl more circumspect and not so familiar and kind to him as befor in which i wa certainli wrong too the honest grate creatur have no thought about it but what consist with the best principl both as a religi christian and as a grate friend as appear afterward to my full satisfact while my jealousi of him last you mai be sure i wa everi dai pump him to see if he would discov ani of the new thought which i suspect were in him but i found everyth he said wa so honest and so innoc that i could find noth to nourish my suspicion and in spite of all my uneasi he made me at last entir hi own again nor did he in the least perceiv that i wa uneasi and therefor i could not suspect him of deceit on dai walk up the same hill but the weather be hazi at sea so that we could not see the contin i call to him and said fridai do not you wish yourself in your own countri your own nation ye he said i be much o glad to be at my own nation what would you do there said i would you turn wild again eat men s flesh again and be a savag as you were befor he look full of concern and shake hi head said no no fridai tell them to live good tell them to prai god tell them to eat corn bread cattl flesh milk no eat man again why then said i to him thei will kill you he look grave at that and then said no no thei no kill me thei will love learn he meant by thi thei would be will to learn he ad thei learn much of the beard man that came in the boat then i ask him if he would go back to them he smile at that and told me that he could not swim so far i told him i would make a cano for him he told me he would go if i would go with him i go sai i why thei will eat me if i come there no no sai he me make thei no eat you me make thei much love you he meant he would tell them how i had kill hi enemi and save hi life and so he would make them love me then he told me as well as he could how kind thei were to seventeen white men or beard men as he call them who came on shore there in distress from thi time i confess i had a mind to ventur over and see if i could possibl join with those beard men who i made no doubt were spaniard and portugues not doubt but if i could we might find some method to escap from thenc be upon the contin and a good compani togeth better than i could from an island forti mile off the shore alon and without help so after some dai i took fridai to work again by wai of discours and told him i would give him a boat to go back to hi own nation and accordingli i carri him to my frigat which lai on the other side of the island and have clear it of water for i alwai kept it sunk in water i brought it out show it him and we both went into it i found he wa a most dexter fellow at manag it and would make it go almost as swift again as i could so when he wa in i said to him well now fridai shall we go to your nation he look veri dull at my sai so which it seem wa becaus he thought the boat wa too small to go so far i then told him i had a bigger so the next dai i went to the place where the first boat lai which i had made but which i could not get into the water he said that wa big enough but then as i had taken no care of it and it had lain two or three and twenti year there the sun had so split and dri it that it wa rotten fridai told me such a boat would do veri well and would carri much enough vittl drink bread thi wa hi wai of talk chapter xvi rescu of prison from cannib upon the whole i wa by thi time so fix upon my design of go over with him to the contin that i told him we would go and make on as big as that and he should go home in it he answer not on word but look veri grave and sad i ask him what wa the matter with him he ask me again why you angri mad with fridai what me done i ask him what he meant i told him i wa not angri with him at all no angri sai he repeat the word sever time why send fridai home awai to my nation why sai i fridai did not you sai you wish you were there ye ye sai he wish we both there no wish fridai there no master there in a word he would not think of go there without me i go there fridai sai i what shall i do there he turn veri quick upon me at thi you do great deal much good sai he you teach wild man be good sober tame man you tell them know god prai god and live new life ala fridai sai i thou knowest not what thou sayest i am but an ignor man myself ye ye sai he you teache me good you teache them good no no fridai sai i you shall go without me leav me here to live by myself as i did befor he look confus again at that word and run to on of the hatchet which he us to wear he take it up hastili and give it to me what must i do with thi sai i to him you take kill fridai sai he what must kill you for said i again he return veri quick what you send fridai awai for take kill fridai no send fridai awai thi he spoke so earnestli that i saw tear stand in hi ey in a word i so plainli discov the utmost affect in him to me and a firm resolut in him that i told him then and often after that i would never send him awai from me if he wa will to stai with me upon the whole as i found by all hi discours a settl affect to me and that noth could part him from me so i found all the foundat of hi desir to go to hi own countri wa laid in hi ardent affect to the peopl and hi hope of my do them good a thing which as i had no notion of myself so i had not the least thought or intent or desir of undertak it but still i found a strong inclin to attempt my escap found on the supposit gather from the discours that there were seventeen beard men there and therefor without ani more delai i went to work with fridai to find out a great tree proper to fell and make a larg periagua or cano to undertak the voyag there were tree enough in the island to have built a littl fleet not of periagua or cano but even of good larg vessel but the main thing i look at wa to get on so near the water that we might launch it when it wa made to avoid the mistak i commit at first at last fridai pitch upon a tree for i found he knew much better than i what kind of wood wa fittest for it nor can i tell to thi dai what wood to call the tree we cut down except that it wa veri like the tree we call fustic or between that and the nicaragua wood for it wa much of the same colour and smell fridai wish to burn the hollow or caviti of thi tree out to make it for a boat but i show him how to cut it with tool which after i had show him how to us he did veri handili and in about a month s hard labour we finish it and made it veri handsom especi when with our ax which i show him how to handl we cut and hew the outsid into the true shape of a boat after thi howev it cost us near a fortnight s time to get her along as it were inch by inch upon great roller into the water but when she wa in she would have carri twenti men with great eas when she wa in the water though she wa so big it amaz me to see with what dexter and how swift my man fridai could manag her turn her and paddl her along so i ask him if he would and if we might ventur over in her ye he said we ventur over in her veri well though great blow wind howev i had a further design that he knew noth of and that wa to make a mast and a sail and to fit her with an anchor and cabl as to a mast that wa easi enough to get so i pitch upon a straight young cedar tree which i found near the place and which there were great plenti of in the island and i set fridai to work to cut it down and gave him direct how to shape and order it but as to the sail that wa my particular care i knew i had old sail or rather piec of old sail enough but as i had had them now six and twenti year by me and had not been veri care to preserv them not imagin that i should ever have thi kind of us for them i did not doubt but thei were all rotten and inde most of them were so howev i found two piec which appear pretti good and with these i went to work and with a great deal of pain and awkward stitch you mai be sure for want of needl i at length made a three corner ugli thing like what we call in england a shoulder of mutton sail to go with a boom at bottom and a littl short sprit at the top such as usual our ship long boat sail with and such as i best knew how to manag as it wa such a on as i had to the boat in which i made my escap from barbari as relat in the first part of my stori i wa near two month perform thi last work viz rig and fit my mast and sail for i finish them veri complet make a small stai and a sail or foresail to it to assist if we should turn to windward and what wa more than all i fix a rudder to the stern of her to steer with i wa but a bungl shipwright yet as i knew the us and even necess of such a thing i appli myself with so much pain to do it that at last i brought it to pass though consid the mani dull contriv i had for it that fail i think it cost me almost as much labour as make the boat after all thi wa done i had my man fridai to teach as to what belong to the navig of my boat though he knew veri well how to paddl a cano he knew noth of what belong to a sail and a rudder and wa the most amaz when he saw me work the boat to and again in the sea by the rudder and how the sail jibe and fill thi wai or that wai as the cours we sail chang i sai when he saw thi he stood like on astonish and amaz howev with a littl us i made all these thing familiar to him and he becam an expert sailor except that of the compass i could make him understand veri littl on the other hand as there wa veri littl cloudi weather and seldom or never ani fog in those part there wa the less occas for a compass see the star were alwai to be seen by night and the shore by dai except in the raini season and then nobodi care to stir abroad either by land or sea i wa now enter on the seven and twentieth year of my captiv in thi place though the three last year that i had thi creatur with me ought rather to be left out of the account my habit be quit of anoth kind than in all the rest of the time i kept the anniversari of my land here with the same thank to god for hi merci as at first and if i had such caus of acknowledg at first i had much more so now have such addit testimoni of the care of provid over me and the great hope i had of be effectu and speedili deliv for i had an invinc impress upon my thought that my deliver wa at hand and that i should not be anoth year in thi place i went on howev with my husbandri dig plant and fenc as usual i gather and cure my grape and did everi necessari thing as befor the raini season wa in the meantim upon me when i kept more within door than at other time we had stow our new vessel as secur as we could bring her up into the creek where as i said in the begin i land my raft from the ship and haul her up to the shore at high water mark i made my man fridai dig a littl dock just big enough to hold her and just deep enough to give her water enough to float in and then when the tide wa out we made a strong dam across the end of it to keep the water out and so she lai dry as to the tide from the sea and to keep the rain off we laid a great mani bough of tree so thick that she wa as well thatch as a hous and thu we wait for the month of novemb and decemb in which i design to make my adventur when the settl season began to come in as the thought of my design return with the fair weather i wa prepar daili for the voyag and the first thing i did wa to lai by a certain quantiti of provis be the store for our voyag and intend in a week or a fortnight s time to open the dock and launch out our boat i wa busi on morn upon someth of thi kind when i call to fridai and bid him to go to the sea shore and see if he could find a turtl or a tortois a thing which we gener got onc a week for the sake of the egg as well as the flesh fridai had not been long gone when he came run back and flew over my outer wall or fenc like on that felt not the ground or the step he set hi foot on and befor i had time to speak to him he cri out to me o master o master o sorrow o bad what s the matter fridai sai i o yonder there sai he on two three cano on two three by thi wai of speak i conclud there were six but on inquiri i found there were but three well fridai sai i do not be frighten so i hearten him up as well as i could howev i saw the poor fellow wa most terribl scare for noth ran in hi head but that thei were come to look for him and would cut him in piec and eat him and the poor fellow trembl so that i scarc knew what to do with him i comfort him as well as i could and told him i wa in as much danger as he and that thei would eat me as well as him but sai i fridai we must resolv to fight them can you fight fridai me shoot sai he but there come mani great number no matter for that said i again our gun will fright them that we do not kill so i ask him whether if i resolv to defend him he would defend me and stand by me and do just as i bid him he said me die when you bid die master so i went and fetch a good dram of rum and gave him for i had been so good a husband of my rum that i had a great deal left when we had drunk it i made him take the two fowl piec which we alwai carri and load them with larg swan shot as big as small pistol bullet then i took four musket and load them with two slug and five small bullet each and my two pistol i load with a brace of bullet each i hung my great sword as usual nake by my side and gave fridai hi hatchet when i had thu prepar myself i took my perspect glass and went up to the side of the hill to see what i could discov and i found quickli by my glass that there were on and twenti savag three prison and three cano and that their whole busi seem to be the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodi a barbar feast inde but noth more than as i had observ wa usual with them i observ also that thei had land not where thei had done when fridai made hi escap but nearer to my creek where the shore wa low and where a thick wood came almost close down to the sea thi with the abhorr of the inhuman errand these wretch came about fill me with such indign that i came down again to fridai and told him i wa resolv to go down to them and kill them all and ask him if he would stand by me he had now got over hi fright and hi spirit be a littl rais with the dram i had given him he wa veri cheer and told me as befor he would die when i bid die in thi fit of furi i divid the arm which i had charg as befor between us i gave fridai on pistol to stick in hi girdl and three gun upon hi shoulder and i took on pistol and the other three gun myself and in thi postur we march out i took a small bottl of rum in my pocket and gave fridai a larg bag with more powder and bullet and as to order i charg him to keep close behind me and not to stir or shoot or do anyth till i bid him and in the meantim not to speak a word in thi postur i fetch a compass to my right hand of near a mile as well to get over the creek as to get into the wood so that i could come within shot of them befor i should be discov which i had seen by my glass it wa easi to do while i wa make thi march my former thought return i began to abat my resolut i do not mean that i entertain ani fear of their number for as thei were nake unarm wretch it is certain i wa superior to them nai though i had been alon but it occur to my thought what call what occas much less what necess i wa in to go and dip my hand in blood to attack peopl who had neither done or intend me ani wrong who as to me were innoc and whose barbar custom were their own disast be in them a token inde of god s have left them with the other nation of that part of the world to such stupid and to such inhuman cours but did not call me to take upon me to be a judg of their action much less an execution of hi justic that whenev he thought fit he would take the caus into hi own hand and by nation vengeanc punish them as a peopl for nation crime but that in the meantim it wa none of my busi that it wa true fridai might justifi it becaus he wa a declar enemi and in a state of war with those veri particular peopl and it wa law for him to attack them but i could not sai the same with regard to myself these thing were so warmli press upon my thought all the wai as i went that i resolv i would onli go and place myself near them that i might observ their barbar feast and that i would act then as god should direct but that unless someth offer that wa more a call to me than yet i knew of i would not meddl with them with thi resolut i enter the wood and with all possibl wari and silenc fridai follow close at my heel i march till i came to the skirt of the wood on the side which wa next to them onli that on corner of the wood lai between me and them here i call softli to fridai and show him a great tree which wa just at the corner of the wood i bade him go to the tree and bring me word if he could see there plainli what thei were do he did so and came immedi back to me and told me thei might be plainli view there that thei were all about their fire eat the flesh of on of their prison and that anoth lai bound upon the sand a littl from them whom he said thei would kill next and thi fire the veri soul within me he told me it wa not on of their nation but on of the beard men he had told me of that came to their countri in the boat i wa fill with horror at the veri name of the white beard man and go to the tree i saw plainli by my glass a white man who lai upon the beach of the sea with hi hand and hi feet ti with flag or thing like rush and that he wa an european and had cloth on there wa anoth tree and a littl thicket beyond it about fifti yard nearer to them than the place where i wa which by go a littl wai about i saw i might come at undiscov and that then i should be within half a shot of them so i withheld my passion though i wa inde enrag to the highest degre and go back about twenti pace i got behind some bush which held all the wai till i came to the other tree and then came to a littl rise ground which gave me a full view of them at the distanc of about eighti yard i had now not a moment to lose for nineteen of the dread wretch sat upon the ground all close huddl togeth and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor christian and bring him perhap limb by limb to their fire and thei were stoop down to unti the band at hi feet i turn to fridai now fridai said i do as i bid thee fridai said he would then fridai sai i do exactli as you see me do fail in noth so i set down on of the musket and the fowl piec upon the ground and fridai did the like by hi and with the other musket i took my aim at the savag bid him to do the like then ask him if he wa readi he said ye then fire at them said i and at the same moment i fire also fridai took hi aim so much better than i that on the side that he shot he kill two of them and wound three more and on my side i kill on and wound two thei were you mai be sure in a dread constern and all of them that were not hurt jump upon their feet but did not immedi know which wai to run or which wai to look for thei knew not from whenc their destruct came fridai kept hi ey close upon me that as i had bid him he might observ what i did so as soon as the first shot wa made i threw down the piec and took up the fowl piec and fridai did the like he saw me cock and present he did the same again ar you readi fridai said i ye sai he let fly then sai i in the name of god and with that i fire again among the amaz wretch and so did fridai and as our piec were now load with what i call swan shot or small pistol bullet we found onli two drop but so mani were wound that thei ran about yell and scream like mad creatur all bloodi and most of them miser wound whereof three more fell quickli after though not quit dead now fridai sai i lai down the discharg piec and take up the musket which wa yet load follow me which he did with a great deal of courag upon which i rush out of the wood and show myself and fridai close at my foot as soon as i perceiv thei saw me i shout as loud as i could and bade fridai do so too and run as fast as i could which by the wai wa not veri fast be load with arm as i wa i made directli toward the poor victim who wa as i said ly upon the beach or shore between the place where thei sat and the sea the two butcher who were just go to work with him had left him at the surpris of our first fire and fled in a terribl fright to the seasid and had jump into a cano and three more of the rest made the same wai i turn to fridai and bade him step forward and fire at them he understood me immedi and run about forti yard to be nearer them he shot at them and i thought he had kill them all for i saw them all fall of a heap into the boat though i saw two of them up again quickli howev he kill two of them and wound the third so that he lai down in the bottom of the boat as if he had been dead while my man fridai fire at them i pull out my knife and cut the flag that bound the poor victim and loos hi hand and feet i lift him up and ask him in the portugues tongu what he wa he answer in latin christianu but wa so weak and faint that he could scarc stand or speak i took my bottl out of my pocket and gave it him make sign that he should drink which he did and i gave him a piec of bread which he at then i ask him what countryman he wa and he said espagniol and be a littl recov let me know by all the sign he could possibl make how much he wa in my debt for hi deliver seignior said i with as much spanish as i could make up we will talk afterward but we must fight now if you have ani strength left take thi pistol and sword and lai about you he took them veri thankfulli and no sooner had he the arm in hi hand but as if thei had put new vigour into him he flew upon hi murder like a furi and had cut two of them in piec in an instant for the truth is as the whole wa a surpris to them so the poor creatur were so much frighten with the nois of our piec that thei fell down for mere amaz and fear and had no more power to attempt their own escap than their flesh had to resist our shot and that wa the case of those five that fridai shot at in the boat for as three of them fell with the hurt thei receiv so the other two fell with the fright i kept my piec in my hand still without fire be will to keep my charg readi becaus i had given the spaniard my pistol and sword so i call to fridai and bade him run up to the tree from whenc we first fire and fetch the arm which lai there that had been discharg which he did with great swift and then give him my musket i sat down myself to load all the rest again and bade them come to me when thei want while i wa load these piec there happen a fierc engag between the spaniard and on of the savag who made at him with on of their great wooden sword the weapon that wa to have kill him befor if i had not prevent it the spaniard who wa as bold and brave as could be imagin though weak had fought the indian a good while and had cut two great wound on hi head but the savag be a stout lusti fellow close in with him had thrown him down be faint and wa wring my sword out of hi hand when the spaniard though undermost wise quit the sword drew the pistol from hi girdl shot the savag through the bodi and kill him upon the spot befor i who wa run to help him could come near him fridai be now left to hi liberti pursu the fly wretch with no weapon in hi hand but hi hatchet and with that he despatch those three who as i said befor were wound at first and fallen and all the rest he could come up with and the spaniard come to me for a gun i gave him on of the fowl piec with which he pursu two of the savag and wound them both but as he wa not abl to run thei both got from him into the wood where fridai pursu them and kill on of them but the other wa too nimbl for him and though he wa wound yet had plung himself into the sea and swam with all hi might off to those two who were left in the cano which three in the cano with on wound that we knew not whether he di or no were all that escap our hand of on and twenti the account of the whole is as follow three kill at our first shot from the tree two kill at the next shot two kill by fridai in the boat two kill by fridai of those at first wound on kill by fridai in the wood three kill by the spaniard four kill be found drop here and there of the wound or kill by fridai in hi chase of them four escap in the boat whereof on wound if not dead twenti on in all those that were in the cano work hard to get out of gun shot and though fridai made two or three shot at them i did not find that he hit ani of them fridai would fain have had me take on of their cano and pursu them and inde i wa veri anxiou about their escap lest carri the new home to their peopl thei should come back perhap with two or three hundr of the cano and devour us by mere multitud so i consent to pursu them by sea and run to on of their cano i jump in and bade fridai follow me but when i wa in the cano i wa surpris to find anoth poor creatur lie there bound hand and foot as the spaniard wa for the slaughter and almost dead with fear not know what wa the matter for he had not been abl to look up over the side of the boat he wa ti so hard neck and heel and had been ti so long that he had realli but littl life in him i immedi cut the twist flag or rush which thei had bound him with and would have help him up but he could not stand or speak but groan most piteous believ it seem still that he wa onli unbound in order to be kill when fridai came to him i bade him speak to him and tell him of hi deliver and pull out my bottl made him give the poor wretch a dram which with the new of hi be deliv reviv him and he sat up in the boat but when fridai came to hear him speak and look in hi face it would have move ani on to tear to have seen how fridai kiss him embrac him hug him cri laugh halloo jump about danc sang then cri again wrung hi hand beat hi own face and head and then sang and jump about again like a distract creatur it wa a good while befor i could make him speak to me or tell me what wa the matter but when he came a littl to himself he told me that it wa hi father it is not easi for me to express how it move me to see what ecstasi and filial affect had work in thi poor savag at the sight of hi father and of hi be deliv from death nor inde can i describ half the extravag of hi affect after thi for he went into the boat and out of the boat a great mani time when he went in to him he would sit down by him open hi breast and hold hi father s head close to hi bosom for mani minut togeth to nourish it then he took hi arm and ankl which were numb and stiff with the bind and chafe and rub them with hi hand and i perceiv what the case wa gave him some rum out of my bottl to rub them with which did them a great deal of good thi affair put an end to our pursuit of the cano with the other savag who were now almost out of sight and it wa happi for us that we did not for it blew so hard within two hour after and befor thei could be got a quarter of their wai and continu blow so hard all night and that from the north west which wa against them that i could not suppos their boat could live or that thei ever reach their own coast but to return to fridai he wa so busi about hi father that i could not find in my heart to take him off for some time but after i thought he could leav him a littl i call him to me and he came jump and laugh and pleas to the highest extrem then i ask him if he had given hi father ani bread he shook hi head and said none ugli dog eat all up self i then gave him a cake of bread out of a littl pouch i carri on purpos i also gave him a dram for himself but he would not tast it but carri it to hi father i had in my pocket two or three bunch of raisin so i gave him a hand of them for hi father he had no sooner given hi father these raisin but i saw him come out of the boat and run awai as if he had been bewitch for he wa the swiftest fellow on hi feet that ever i saw i sai he ran at such a rate that he wa out of sight as it were in an instant and though i call and halloo out too after him it wa all on awai he went and in a quarter of an hour i saw him come back again though not so fast as he went and as he came nearer i found hi pace slacker becaus he had someth in hi hand when he came up to me i found he had been quit home for an earthen jug or pot to bring hi father some fresh water and that he had got two more cake or loav of bread the bread he gave me but the water he carri to hi father howev as i wa veri thirsti too i took a littl of it the water reviv hi father more than all the rum or spirit i had given him for he wa faint with thirst when hi father had drunk i call to him to know if there wa ani water left he said ye and i bade him give it to the poor spaniard who wa in as much want of it as hi father and i sent on of the cake that fridai brought to the spaniard too who wa inde veri weak and wa repos himself upon a green place under the shade of a tree and whose limb were also veri stiff and veri much swell with the rude bandag he had been ti with when i saw that upon fridai s come to him with the water he sat up and drank and took the bread and began to eat i went to him and gave him a hand of raisin he look up in my face with all the token of gratitud and thank that could appear in ani counten but wa so weak notwithstand he had so exert himself in the fight that he could not stand up upon hi feet he tri to do it two or three time but wa realli not abl hi ankl were so swell and so pain to him so i bade him sit still and caus fridai to rub hi ankl and bath them with rum as he had done hi father s i observ the poor affection creatur everi two minut or perhap less all the while he wa here turn hi head about to see if hi father wa in the same place and postur as he left him sit and at last he found he wa not to be seen at which he start up and without speak a word flew with that swift to him that on could scarc perceiv hi feet to touch the ground as he went but when he came he onli found he had laid himself down to eas hi limb so fridai came back to me present and then i spoke to the spaniard to let fridai help him up if he could and lead him to the boat and then he should carri him to our dwell where i would take care of him but fridai a lusti strong fellow took the spaniard upon hi back and carri him awai to the boat and set him down softli upon the side or gunnel of the cano with hi feet in the insid of it and then lift him quit in he set him close to hi father and present step out again launch the boat off and paddl it along the shore faster than i could walk though the wind blew pretti hard too so he brought them both safe into our creek and leav them in the boat ran awai to fetch the other cano as he pass me i spoke to him and ask him whither he went he told me go fetch more boat so awai he went like the wind for sure never man or hors ran like him and he had the other cano in the creek almost as soon as i got to it by land so he waft me over and then went to help our new guest out of the boat which he did but thei were neither of them abl to walk so that poor fridai knew not what to do to remedi thi i went to work in my thought and call to fridai to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me i soon made a kind of hand barrow to lai them on and fridai and i carri them both up togeth upon it between us but when we got them to the outsid of our wall or fortif we were at a wors loss than befor for it wa imposs to get them over and i wa resolv not to break it down so i set to work again and fridai and i in about two hour time made a veri handsom tent cover with old sail and abov that with bough of tree be in the space without our outward fenc and between that and the grove of young wood which i had plant and here we made them two bed of such thing as i had viz of good rice straw with blanket laid upon it to lie on and anoth to cover them on each bed my island wa now peopl and i thought myself veri rich in subject and it wa a merri reflect which i frequent made how like a king i look first of all the whole countri wa my own properti so that i had an undoubt right of dominion secondli my peopl were perfectli subject i wa absolut lord and lawgiv thei all ow their live to me and were readi to lai down their live if there had been occas for it for me it wa remark too i had but three subject and thei were of three differ religion my man fridai wa a protest hi father wa a pagan and a cannib and the spaniard wa a papist howev i allow liberti of conscienc throughout my dominion but thi is by the wai as soon as i had secur my two weak rescu prison and given them shelter and a place to rest them upon i began to think of make some provis for them and the first thing i did i order fridai to take a yearl goat betwixt a kid and a goat out of my particular flock to be kill when i cut off the hinder quarter and chop it into small piec i set fridai to work to boil and stew and made them a veri good dish i assur you of flesh and broth and as i cook it without door for i made no fire within my inner wall so i carri it all into the new tent and have set a tabl there for them i sat down and at my own dinner also with them and as well as i could cheer them and encourag them fridai wa my interpret especi to hi father and inde to the spaniard too for the spaniard spoke the languag of the savag pretti well after we had dine or rather sup i order fridai to take on of the cano and go and fetch our musket and other firearm which for want of time we had left upon the place of battl and the next dai i order him to go and buri the dead bodi of the savag which lai open to the sun and would present be offens i also order him to buri the horrid remain of their barbar feast which i could not think of do myself nai i could not bear to see them if i went that wai all which he punctual perform and effac the veri appear of the savag be there so that when i went again i could scarc know where it wa otherwis than by the corner of the wood point to the place i then began to enter into a littl convers with my two new subject and first i set fridai to inquir of hi father what he thought of the escap of the savag in that cano and whether we might expect a return of them with a power too great for us to resist hi first opinion wa that the savag in the boat never could live out the storm which blew that night thei went off but must of necess be drown or driven south to those other shore where thei were as sure to be devour as thei were to be drown if thei were cast awai but as to what thei would do if thei came safe on shore he said he knew not but it wa hi opinion that thei were so dreadfulli frighten with the manner of their be attack the nois and the fire that he believ thei would tell the peopl thei were all kill by thunder and lightn not by the hand of man and that the two which appear viz fridai and i were two heavenli spirit or furi come down to destroi them and not men with weapon thi he said he knew becaus he heard them all cry out so in their languag on to anoth for it wa imposs for them to conceiv that a man could dart fire and speak thunder and kill at a distanc without lift up the hand as wa done now and thi old savag wa in the right for as i understood sinc by other hand the savag never attempt to go over to the island afterward thei were so terrifi with the account given by those four men for it seem thei did escap the sea that thei believ whoever went to that enchant island would be destroi with fire from the god thi howev i knew not and therefor wa under continu apprehens for a good while and kept alwai upon my guard with all my armi for as there were now four of us i would have ventur upon a hundr of them fairli in the open field at ani time chapter xvii visit of mutin in a littl time howev no more cano appear the fear of their come wore off and i began to take my former thought of a voyag to the main into consider be likewis assur by fridai s father that i might depend upon good usag from their nation on hi account if i would go but my thought were a littl suspend when i had a seriou discours with the spaniard and when i understood that there were sixteen more of hi countrymen and portugues who have been cast awai and made their escap to that side live there at peac inde with the savag but were veri sore put to it for necessari and inde for life i ask him all the particular of their voyag and found thei were a spanish ship bound from the rio de la plata to the havanna be direct to leav their load there which wa chiefli hide and silver and to bring back what european good thei could meet with there that thei had five portugues seamen on board whom thei took out of anoth wreck that five of their own men were drown when first the ship wa lost and that these escap through infinit danger and hazard and arriv almost starv on the cannib coast where thei expect to have been devour everi moment he told me thei had some arm with them but thei were perfectli useless for that thei had neither powder nor ball the wash of the sea have spoil all their powder but a littl which thei us at their first land to provid themselv with some food i ask him what he thought would becom of them there and if thei had form ani design of make their escap he said thei had mani consult about it but that have neither vessel nor tool to build on nor provis of ani kind their council alwai end in tear and despair i ask him how he thought thei would receiv a propos from me which might tend toward an escap and whether if thei were all here it might not be done i told him with freedom i fear mostli their treacheri and ill usag of me if i put my life in their hand for that gratitud wa no inher virtu in the natur of man nor did men alwai squar their deal by the oblig thei had receiv so much as thei did by the advantag thei expect i told him it would be veri hard that i should be made the instrument of their deliver and that thei should afterward make me their prison in new spain where an englishman wa certain to be made a sacrific what necess or what accid soever brought him thither and that i had rather be deliv up to the savag and be devour aliv than fall into the merciless claw of the priest and be carri into the inquisit i ad that otherwis i wa persuad if thei were all here we might with so mani hand build a barqu larg enough to carri us all awai either to the brazil southward or to the island or spanish coast northward but that if in requit thei should when i had put weapon into their hand carri me by forc among their own peopl i might be ill us for my kind to them and make my case wors than it wa befor he answer with a great deal of candour and ingenu that their condit wa so miser and that thei were so sensibl of it that he believ thei would abhor the thought of us ani man unkindli that should contribut to their deliver and that if i pleas he would go to them with the old man and discours with them about it and return again and bring me their answer that he would make condit with them upon their solemn oath that thei should be absolut under my direct as their command and captain and thei should swear upon the holi sacrament and gospel to be true to me and go to such christian countri as i should agre to and no other and to be direct wholli and absolut by my order till thei were land safe in such countri as i intend and that he would bring a contract from them under their hand for that purpos then he told me he would first swear to me himself that he would never stir from me as long as he live till i gave him order and that he would take my side to the last drop of hi blood if there should happen the least breach of faith among hi countrymen he told me thei were all of them veri civil honest men and thei were under the greatest distress imagin have neither weapon nor cloth nor ani food but at the merci and discret of the savag out of all hope of ever return to their own countri and that he wa sure if i would undertak their relief thei would live and die by me upon these assur i resolv to ventur to reliev them if possibl and to send the old savag and thi spaniard over to them to treat but when we had got all thing in readi to go the spaniard himself start an object which had so much prudenc in it on on hand and so much sincer on the other hand that i could not but be veri well satisfi in it and by hi advic put off the deliver of hi comrad for at least half a year the case wa thu he had been with us now about a month dure which time i had let him see in what manner i had provid with the assist of provid for my support and he saw evid what stock of corn and rice i had laid up which though it wa more than suffici for myself yet it wa not suffici without good husbandri for my famili now it wa increas to four but much less would it be suffici if hi countrymen who were as he said sixteen still aliv should come over and least of all would it be suffici to victual our vessel if we should build on for a voyag to ani of the christian coloni of america so he told me he thought it would be more advis to let him and the other two dig and cultiv some more land as much as i could spare seed to sow and that we should wait anoth harvest that we might have a suppli of corn for hi countrymen when thei should come for want might be a temptat to them to disagre or not to think themselv deliv otherwis than out of on difficulti into anoth you know sai he the children of israel though thei rejoic at first for their be deliv out of egypt yet rebel even against god himself that deliv them when thei came to want bread in the wilder hi caution wa so season and hi advic so good that i could not but be veri well pleas with hi propos as well as i wa satisfi with hi fidel so we fell to dig all four of us as well as the wooden tool we were furnish with permit and in about a month s time by the end of which it wa seed time we had got as much land cure and trim up as we sow two and twenti bushel of barlei on and sixteen jar of rice which wa in short all the seed we had to spare inde we left ourselv bare suffici for our own food for the six month that we had to expect our crop that is to sai reckon from the time we set our seed asid for sow for it is not to be suppos it is six month in the ground in that countri have now societi enough and our number be suffici to put us out of fear of the savag if thei had come unless their number had been veri great we went freeli all over the island whenev we found occas and as we had our escap or deliver upon our thought it wa imposs at least for me to have the mean of it out of mine for thi purpos i mark out sever tree which i thought fit for our work and i set fridai and hi father to cut them down and then i caus the spaniard to whom i impart my thought on that affair to overse and direct their work i show them with what indefatig pain i had hew a larg tree into singl plank and i caus them to do the like till thei made about a dozen larg plank of good oak near two feet broad thirti five feet long and from two inch to four inch thick what prodigi labour it took up ani on mai imagin at the same time i contriv to increas my littl flock of tame goat as much as i could and for thi purpos i made fridai and the spaniard go out on dai and myself with fridai the next dai for we took our turn and by thi mean we got about twenti young kid to breed up with the rest for whenev we shot the dam we save the kid and ad them to our flock but abov all the season for cure the grape come on i caus such a prodigi quantiti to be hung up in the sun that i believ had we been at alic where the raisin of the sun ar cure we could have fill sixti or eighti barrel and these with our bread form a great part of our food veri good live too i assur you for thei ar exceedingli nourish it wa now harvest and our crop in good order it wa not the most plenti increas i had seen in the island but howev it wa enough to answer our end for from twenti two bushel of barlei we brought in and thrash out abov two hundr and twenti bushel and the like in proport of the rice which wa store enough for our food to the next harvest though all the sixteen spaniard had been on shore with me or if we had been readi for a voyag it would veri plentifulli have victual our ship to have carri us to ani part of the world that is to sai ani part of america when we had thu hous and secur our magazin of corn we fell to work to make more wicker ware viz great basket in which we kept it and the spaniard wa veri handi and dexter at thi part and often blame me that i did not make some thing for defenc of thi kind of work but i saw no need of it and now have a full suppli of food for all the guest i expect i gave the spaniard leav to go over to the main to see what he could do with those he had left behind him there i gave him a strict charg not to bring ani man who would not first swear in the presenc of himself and the old savag that he would in no wai injur fight with or attack the person he should find in the island who wa so kind as to send for them in order to their deliver but that thei would stand by him and defend him against all such attempt and wherev thei went would be entir under and subject to hi command and that thi should be put in write and sign in their hand how thei were to have done thi when i knew thei had neither pen nor ink wa a question which we never ask under these instruct the spaniard and the old savag the father of fridai went awai in on of the cano which thei might be said to have come in or rather were brought in when thei came as prison to be devour by the savag i gave each of them a musket with a firelock on it and about eight charg of powder and ball charg them to be veri good husband of both and not to us either of them but upon urgent occas thi wa a cheer work be the first measur us by me in view of my deliver for now twenti seven year and some dai i gave them provis of bread and of dri grape suffici for themselv for mani dai and suffici for all the spaniard for about eight dai time and wish them a good voyag i saw them go agre with them about a signal thei should hang out at their return by which i should know them again when thei came back at a distanc befor thei came on shore thei went awai with a fair gale on the dai that the moon wa at full by my account in the month of octob but as for an exact reckon of dai after i had onc lost it i could never recov it again nor had i kept even the number of year so punctual as to be sure i wa right though as it prove when i afterward examin my account i found i had kept a true reckon of year it wa no less than eight dai i had wait for them when a strang and unforeseen accid interven of which the like ha not perhap been heard of in histori i wa fast asleep in my hutch on morn when my man fridai came run in to me and call aloud master master thei ar come thei ar come i jump up and regardless of danger i went as soon as i could get my cloth on through my littl grove which by the wai wa by thi time grown to be a veri thick wood i sai regardless of danger i went without my arm which wa not my custom to do but i wa surpris when turn my ey to the sea i present saw a boat at about a leagu and a half distanc stand in for the shore with a shoulder of mutton sail as thei call it and the wind blow pretti fair to bring them in also i observ present that thei did not come from that side which the shore lai on but from the southernmost end of the island upon thi i call fridai in and bade him lie close for these were not the peopl we look for and that we might not know yet whether thei were friend or enemi in the next place i went in to fetch my perspect glass to see what i could make of them and have taken the ladder out i climb up to the top of the hill as i us to do when i wa apprehens of anyth and to take my view the plainer without be discov i had scarc set my foot upon the hill when my ey plainli discov a ship ly at anchor at about two leagu and a half distanc from me sse but not abov a leagu and a half from the shore by my observ it appear plainli to be an english ship and the boat appear to be an english long boat i cannot express the confus i wa in though the joi of see a ship and on that i had reason to believ wa man by my own countrymen and consequ friend wa such as i cannot describ but yet i had some secret doubt hung about me i cannot tell from whenc thei came bid me keep upon my guard in the first place it occur to me to consid what busi an english ship could have in that part of the world sinc it wa not the wai to or from ani part of the world where the english had ani traffic and i knew there had been no storm to drive them in there in distress and that if thei were realli english it wa most probabl that thei were here upon no good design and that i had better continu as i wa than fall into the hand of thiev and murder let no man despis the secret hint and notic of danger which sometim ar given him when he mai think there is no possibl of it be real that such hint and notic ar given us i believ few that have made ani observ of thing can deni that thei ar certain discoveri of an invis world and a convers of spirit we cannot doubt and if the tendenc of them seem to be to warn us of danger why should we not suppos thei ar from some friendli agent whether suprem or inferior and subordin is not the question and that thei ar given for our good the present question abundantli confirm me in the justic of thi reason for had i not been made cautiou by thi secret admonit come it from whenc it will i had been done inevit and in a far wors condit than befor as you will see present i had not kept myself long in thi postur till i saw the boat draw near the shore as if thei look for a creek to thrust in at for the conveni of land howev as thei did not come quit far enough thei did not see the littl inlet where i formerli land my raft but ran their boat on shore upon the beach at about half a mile from me which wa veri happi for me for otherwis thei would have land just at my door as i mai sai and would soon have beaten me out of my castl and perhap have plunder me of all i had when thei were on shore i wa fulli satisfi thei were englishmen at least most of them on or two i thought were dutch but it did not prove so there were in all eleven men whereof three of them i found were unarm and as i thought bound and when the first four or five of them were jump on shore thei took those three out of the boat as prison on of the three i could perceiv us the most passion gestur of entreati afflict and despair even to a kind of extravag the other two i could perceiv lift up their hand sometim and appear concern inde but not to such a degre as the first i wa perfectli confound at the sight and knew not what the mean of it should be fridai call out to me in english as well as he could o master you see english man eat prison as well as savag man why fridai sai i do you think thei ar go to eat them then ye sai fridai thei will eat them no no sai i fridai i am afraid thei will murder them inde but you mai be sure thei will not eat them all thi while i had no thought of what the matter realli wa but stood trembl with the horror of the sight expect everi moment when the three prison should be kill nai onc i saw on of the villain lift up hi arm with a great cutlass as the seamen call it or sword to strike on of the poor men and i expect to see him fall everi moment at which all the blood in my bodi seem to run chill in my vein i wish heartili now for the spaniard and the savag that had gone with him or that i had ani wai to have come undiscov within shot of them that i might have secur the three men for i saw no firearm thei had among them but it fell out to my mind anoth wai after i had observ the outrag usag of the three men by the insol seamen i observ the fellow run scatter about the island as if thei want to see the countri i observ that the three other men had liberti to go also where thei pleas but thei sat down all three upon the ground veri pensiv and look like men in despair thi put me in mind of the first time when i came on shore and began to look about me how i gave myself over for lost how wildli i look round me what dread apprehens i had and how i lodg in the tree all night for fear of be devour by wild beast as i knew noth that night of the suppli i wa to receiv by the providenti drive of the ship nearer the land by the storm and tide by which i have sinc been so long nourish and support so these three poor desol men knew noth how certain of deliver and suppli thei were how near it wa to them and how effectu and realli thei were in a condit of safeti at the same time that thei thought themselv lost and their case desper so littl do we see befor us in the world and so much reason have we to depend cheerfulli upon the great maker of the world that he doe not leav hi creatur so absolut destitut but that in the worst circumst thei have alwai someth to be thank for and sometim ar nearer deliver than thei imagin nai ar even brought to their deliver by the mean by which thei seem to be brought to their destruct it wa just at high water when these peopl came on shore and while thei rambl about to see what kind of a place thei were in thei had carelessli stai till the tide wa spent and the water wa eb consider awai leav their boat aground thei had left two men in the boat who as i found afterward have drunk a littl too much brandi fell asleep howev on of them wake a littl sooner than the other and find the boat too fast aground for him to stir it halloo out for the rest who were straggl about upon which thei all soon came to the boat but it wa past all their strength to launch her the boat be veri heavi and the shore on that side be a soft oozi sand almost like a quicksand in thi condit like true seamen who ar perhap the least of all mankind given to forethought thei gave it over and awai thei stroll about the countri again and i heard on of them sai aloud to anoth call them off from the boat why let her alon jack can t you she ll float next tide by which i wa fulli confirm in the main inquiri of what countrymen thei were all thi while i kept myself veri close not onc dare to stir out of my castl ani farther than to my place of observ near the top of the hill and veri glad i wa to think how well it wa fortifi i knew it wa no less than ten hour befor the boat could float again and by that time it would be dark and i might be at more liberti to see their motion and to hear their discours if thei had ani in the meantim i fit myself up for a battl as befor though with more caution know i had to do with anoth kind of enemi than i had at first i order fridai also whom i had made an excel marksman with hi gun to load himself with arm i took myself two fowl piec and i gave him three musket my figur inde wa veri fierc i had my formid goat skin coat on with the great cap i have mention a nake sword by my side two pistol in my belt and a gun upon each shoulder it wa my design as i said abov not to have made ani attempt till it wa dark but about two o clock be the heat of the dai i found that thei were all gone straggl into the wood and as i thought laid down to sleep the three poor distress men too anxiou for their condit to get ani sleep had howev sat down under the shelter of a great tree at about a quarter of a mile from me and as i thought out of sight of ani of the rest upon thi i resolv to discov myself to them and learn someth of their condit immedi i march as abov my man fridai at a good distanc behind me as formid for hi arm as i but not make quit so stare a spectr like figur as i did i came as near them undiscov as i could and then befor ani of them saw me i call aloud to them in spanish what ar ye gentlemen thei start up at the nois but were ten time more confound when thei saw me and the uncouth figur that i made thei made no answer at all but i thought i perceiv them just go to fly from me when i spoke to them in english gentlemen said i do not be surpris at me perhap you mai have a friend near when you did not expect it he must be sent directli from heaven then said on of them veri grave to me and pull off hi hat at the same time to me for our condit is past the help of man all help is from heaven sir said i but can you put a stranger in the wai to help you for you seem to be in some great distress i saw you when you land and when you seem to make applic to the brute that came with you i saw on of them lift up hi sword to kill you the poor man with tear run down hi face and trembl look like on astonish return am i talk to god or man is it a real man or an angel be in no fear about that sir said i if god had sent an angel to reliev you he would have come better cloth and arm after anoth manner than you see me prai lai asid your fear i am a man an englishman and dispos to assist you you see i have on servant onli we have arm and ammunit tell us freeli can we serv you what is your case our case sir said he is too long to tell you while our murder ar so near us but in short sir i wa command of that ship my men have mutini against me thei have been hardli prevail on not to murder me and at last have set me on shore in thi desol place with these two men with me on my mate the other a passeng where we expect to perish believ the place to be uninhabit and know not yet what to think of it where ar these brute your enemi said i do you know where thei ar gone there thei lie sir said he point to a thicket of tree my heart trembl for fear thei have seen us and heard you speak if thei have thei will certainli murder us all have thei ani firearm said i he answer thei had onli two piec on of which thei left in the boat well then said i leav the rest to me i see thei ar all asleep it is an easi thing to kill them all but shall we rather take them prison he told me there were two desper villain among them that it wa scarc safe to show ani merci to but if thei were secur he believ all the rest would return to their duti i ask him which thei were he told me he could not at that distanc distinguish them but he would obei my order in anyth i would direct well sai i let us retreat out of their view or hear lest thei awak and we will resolv further so thei willingli went back with me till the wood cover us from them look you sir said i if i ventur upon your deliver ar you will to make two condit with me he anticip my propos by tell me that both he and the ship if recov should be wholli direct and command by me in everyth and if the ship wa not recov he would live and die with me in what part of the world soever i would send him and the two other men said the same well sai i my condit ar but two first that while you stai in thi island with me you will not pretend to ani author here and if i put arm in your hand you will upon all occas give them up to me and do no prejudic to me or mine upon thi island and in the meantim be govern by my order secondli that if the ship is or mai be recov you will carri me and my man to england passag free he gave me all the assur that the invent or faith of man could devis that he would compli with these most reason demand and besid would ow hi life to me and acknowledg it upon all occas as long as he live well then said i here ar three musket for you with powder and ball tell me next what you think is proper to be done he show all the testimoni of hi gratitud that he wa abl but offer to be wholli guid by me i told him i thought it wa veri hard ventur anyth but the best method i could think of wa to fire on them at onc as thei lai and if ani were not kill at the first vollei and offer to submit we might save them and so put it wholli upon god s provid to direct the shot he said veri modestli that he wa loath to kill them if he could help it but that those two were incorrig villain and had been the author of all the mutini in the ship and if thei escap we should be undon still for thei would go on board and bring the whole ship s compani and destroi us all well then sai i necess legitim my advic for it is the onli wai to save our live howev see him still cautiou of shed blood i told him thei should go themselv and manag as thei found conveni in the middl of thi discours we heard some of them awak and soon after we saw two of them on their feet i ask him if either of them were the head of the mutini he said no well then said i you mai let them escap and provid seem to have awaken them on purpos to save themselv now sai i if the rest escap you it is your fault anim with thi he took the musket i had given him in hi hand and a pistol in hi belt and hi two comrad with him with each a piec in hi hand the two men who were with him go first made some nois at which on of the seamen who wa awak turn about and see them come cri out to the rest but wa too late then for the moment he cri out thei fire i mean the two men the captain wise reserv hi own piec thei had so well aim their shot at the men thei knew that on of them wa kill on the spot and the other veri much wound but not be dead he start up on hi feet and call eagerli for help to the other but the captain step to him told him it wa too late to cry for help he should call upon god to forgiv hi villaini and with that word knock him down with the stock of hi musket so that he never spoke more there were three more in the compani and on of them wa slightli wound by thi time i wa come and when thei saw their danger and that it wa in vain to resist thei beg for merci the captain told them he would spare their live if thei would give him an assur of their abhorr of the treacheri thei had been guilti of and would swear to be faith to him in recov the ship and afterward in carri her back to jamaica from whenc thei came thei gave him all the protest of their sincer that could be desir and he wa will to believ them and spare their live which i wa not against onli that i oblig him to keep them bound hand and foot while thei were on the island while thi wa do i sent fridai with the captain s mate to the boat with order to secur her and bring awai the oar and sail which thei did and by and by three straggl men that were happili for them part from the rest came back upon hear the gun fire and see the captain who wa befor their prison now their conqueror thei submit to be bound also and so our victori wa complet it now remain that the captain and i should inquir into on anoth s circumst i began first and told him my whole histori which he heard with an attent even to amaz and particularli at the wonder manner of my be furnish with provis and ammunit and inde as my stori is a whole collect of wonder it affect him deepli but when he reflect from thenc upon himself and how i seem to have been preserv there on purpos to save hi life the tear ran down hi face and he could not speak a word more after thi commun wa at an end i carri him and hi two men into my apart lead them in just where i came out viz at the top of the hous where i refresh them with such provis as i had and show them all the contriv i had made dure my long long inhabit that place all i show them all i said to them wa perfectli amaz but abov all the captain admir my fortif and how perfectli i had conceal my retreat with a grove of tree which have been now plant nearli twenti year and the tree grow much faster than in england wa becom a littl wood so thick that it wa impass in ani part of it but at that on side where i had reserv my littl wind passag into it i told him thi wa my castl and my resid but that i had a seat in the countri as most princ have whither i could retreat upon occas and i would show him that too anoth time but at present our busi wa to consid how to recov the ship he agre with me as to that but told me he wa perfectli at a loss what measur to take for that there were still six and twenti hand on board who have enter into a curs conspiraci by which thei had all forfeit their live to the law would be harden in it now by desper and would carri it on know that if thei were subdu thei would be brought to the gallow as soon as thei came to england or to ani of the english coloni and that therefor there would be no attack them with so small a number as we were i muse for some time on what he had said and found it wa a veri ration conclus and that therefor someth wa to be resolv on speedili as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their surpris as to prevent their land upon us and destroi us upon thi it present occur to me that in a littl while the ship s crew wonder what wa becom of their comrad and of the boat would certainli come on shore in their other boat to look for them and that then perhap thei might come arm and be too strong for us thi he allow to be ration upon thi i told him the first thing we had to do wa to stave the boat which lai upon the beach so that thei might not carri her of and take everyth out of her leav her so far useless as not to be fit to swim accordingli we went on board took the arm which were left on board out of her and whatev els we found there which wa a bottl of brandi and anoth of rum a few biscuit cake a horn of powder and a great lump of sugar in a piec of canva the sugar wa five or six pound all which wa veri welcom to me especi the brandi and sugar of which i had had none left for mani year when we had carri all these thing on shore the oar mast sail and rudder of the boat were carri awai befor we knock a great hole in her bottom that if thei had come strong enough to master us yet thei could not carri off the boat inde it wa not much in my thought that we could be abl to recov the ship but my view wa that if thei went awai without the boat i did not much question to make her again fit to carri as to the leeward island and call upon our friend the spaniard in my wai for i had them still in my thought chapter xviii the ship recov while we were thu prepar our design and had first by main strength heav the boat upon the beach so high that the tide would not float her off at high water mark and besid had broke a hole in her bottom too big to be quickli stop and were set down muse what we should do we heard the ship fire a gun and make a waft with her ensign as a signal for the boat to come on board but no boat stir and thei fire sever time make other signal for the boat at last when all their signal and fire prove fruitless and thei found the boat did not stir we saw them by the help of my glass hoist anoth boat out and row toward the shore and we found as thei approach that there were no less than ten men in her and that thei had firearm with them as the ship lai almost two leagu from the shore we had a full view of them as thei came and a plain sight even of their face becaus the tide have set them a littl to the east of the other boat thei row up under shore to come to the same place where the other had land and where the boat lai by thi mean i sai we had a full view of them and the captain knew the person and charact of all the men in the boat of whom he said there were three veri honest fellow who he wa sure were led into thi conspiraci by the rest be over power and frighten but that as for the boatswain who it seem wa the chief offic among them and all the rest thei were as outrag as ani of the ship s crew and were no doubt made desper in their new enterpris and terribl apprehens he wa that thei would be too power for us i smile at him and told him that men in our circumst were past the oper of fear that see almost everi condit that could be wa better than that which we were suppos to be in we ought to expect that the consequ whether death or life would be sure to be a deliver i ask him what he thought of the circumst of my life and whether a deliver were not worth ventur for and where sir said i is your belief of my be preserv here on purpos to save your life which elev you a littl while ago for my part said i there seem to be but on thing amiss in all the prospect of it what is that sai he why said i it is that as you sai there ar three or four honest fellow among them which should be spare had thei been all of the wick part of the crew i should have thought god s provid had singl them out to deliv them into your hand for depend upon it everi man that come ashor is our own and shall die or live as thei behav to us as i spoke thi with a rais voic and cheer counten i found it greatli encourag him so we set vigor to our busi we had upon the first appear of the boat s come from the ship consid of separ our prison and we had inde secur them effectu two of them of whom the captain wa less assur than ordinari i sent with fridai and on of the three deliv men to my cave where thei were remot enough and out of danger of be heard or discov or of find their wai out of the wood if thei could have deliv themselv here thei left them bound but gave them provis and promis them if thei continu there quietli to give them their liberti in a dai or two but that if thei attempt their escap thei should be put to death without merci thei promis faithfulli to bear their confin with patienc and were veri thank that thei had such good usag as to have provis and light left them for fridai gave them candl such as we made ourselv for their comfort and thei did not know but that he stood sentinel over them at the entranc the other prison had better usag two of them were kept pinion inde becaus the captain wa not abl to trust them but the other two were taken into my servic upon the captain s recommend and upon their solemnli engag to live and die with us so with them and the three honest men we were seven men well arm and i made no doubt we should be abl to deal well enough with the ten that were come consid that the captain had said there were three or four honest men among them also as soon as thei got to the place where their other boat lai thei ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore haul the boat up after them which i wa glad to see for i wa afraid thei would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distanc from the shore with some hand in her to guard her and so we should not be abl to seiz the boat be on shore the first thing thei did thei ran all to their other boat and it wa easi to see thei were under a great surpris to find her strip as abov of all that wa in her and a great hole in her bottom after thei had muse a while upon thi thei set up two or three great shout halloo with all their might to try if thei could make their companion hear but all wa to no purpos then thei came all close in a ring and fire a vollei of their small arm which inde we heard and the echo made the wood ring but it wa all on those in the cave we were sure could not hear and those in our keep though thei heard it well enough yet durst give no answer to them thei were so astonish at the surpris of thi that as thei told us afterward thei resolv to go all on board again to their ship and let them know that the men were all murder and the long boat stave accordingli thei immedi launch their boat again and got all of them on board the captain wa terribl amaz and even confound at thi believ thei would go on board the ship again and set sail give their comrad over for lost and so he should still lose the ship which he wa in hope we should have recov but he wa quickli as much frighten the other wai thei had not been long put off with the boat when we perceiv them all come on shore again but with thi new measur in their conduct which it seem thei consult togeth upon viz to leav three men in the boat and the rest to go on shore and go up into the countri to look for their fellow thi wa a great disappoint to us for now we were at a loss what to do as our seiz those seven men on shore would be no advantag to us if we let the boat escap becaus thei would row awai to the ship and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail and so our recov the ship would be lost howev we had no remedi but to wait and see what the issu of thing might present the seven men came on shore and the three who remain in the boat put her off to a good distanc from the shore and came to an anchor to wait for them so that it wa imposs for us to come at them in the boat those that came on shore kept close togeth march toward the top of the littl hill under which my habit lai and we could see them plainli though thei could not perceiv us we should have been veri glad if thei would have come nearer us so that we might have fire at them or that thei would have gone farther off that we might come abroad but when thei were come to the brow of the hill where thei could see a great wai into the vallei and wood which lai toward the north east part and where the island lai lowest thei shout and halloo till thei were weari and not care it seem to ventur far from the shore nor far from on anoth thei sat down togeth under a tree to consid it had thei thought fit to have gone to sleep there as the other part of them had done thei had done the job for us but thei were too full of apprehens of danger to ventur to go to sleep though thei could not tell what the danger wa thei had to fear the captain made a veri just propos to me upon thi consult of their viz that perhap thei would all fire a vollei again to endeavour to make their fellow hear and that we should all salli upon them just at the junctur when their piec were all discharg and thei would certainli yield and we should have them without bloodsh i like thi propos provid it wa done while we were near enough to come up to them befor thei could load their piec again but thi event did not happen and we lai still a long time veri irresolut what cours to take at length i told them there would be noth done in my opinion till night and then if thei did not return to the boat perhap we might find a wai to get between them and the shore and so might us some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore we wait a great while though veri impati for their remov and were veri uneasi when after long consult we saw them all start up and march down toward the sea it seem thei had such dread apprehens of the danger of the place that thei resolv to go on board the ship again give their companion over for lost and so go on with their intend voyag with the ship as soon as i perceiv them go toward the shore i imagin it to be as it realli wa that thei had given over their search and were go back again and the captain as soon as i told him my thought wa readi to sink at the apprehens of it but i present thought of a stratagem to fetch them back again and which answer my end to a tittl i order fridai and the captain s mate to go over the littl creek westward toward the place where the savag came on shore when fridai wa rescu and so soon as thei came to a littl rise round at about half a mile distant i bid them halloo out as loud as thei could and wait till thei found the seamen heard them that as soon as ever thei heard the seamen answer them thei should return it again and then keep out of sight take a round alwai answer when the other halloo to draw them as far into the island and among the wood as possibl and then wheel about again to me by such wai as i direct them thei were just go into the boat when fridai and the mate halloo and thei present heard them and answer ran along the shore westward toward the voic thei heard when thei were stop by the creek where the water be up thei could not get over and call for the boat to come up and set them over as inde i expect when thei had set themselv over i observ that the boat be gone a good wai into the creek and as it were in a harbour within the land thei took on of the three men out of her to go along with them and left onli two in the boat have fasten her to the stump of a littl tree on the shore thi wa what i wish for and immedi leav fridai and the captain s mate to their busi i took the rest with me and cross the creek out of their sight we surpris the two men befor thei were awar on of them ly on the shore and the other be in the boat the fellow on shore wa between sleep and wake and go to start up the captain who wa foremost ran in upon him and knock him down and then call out to him in the boat to yield or he wa a dead man thei need veri few argument to persuad a singl man to yield when he saw five men upon him and hi comrad knock down besid thi wa it seem on of the three who were not so hearti in the mutini as the rest of the crew and therefor wa easili persuad not onli to yield but afterward to join veri sincer with us in the meantim fridai and the captain s mate so well manag their busi with the rest that thei drew them by halloo and answer from on hill to anoth and from on wood to anoth till thei not onli heartili tire them but left them where thei were veri sure thei could not reach back to the boat befor it wa dark and inde thei were heartili tire themselv also by the time thei came back to us we had noth now to do but to watch for them in the dark and to fall upon them so as to make sure work with them it wa sever hour after fridai came back to me befor thei came back to their boat and we could hear the foremost of them long befor thei came quit up call to those behind to come along and could also hear them answer and complain how lame and tire thei were and not abl to come ani faster which wa veri welcom new to us at length thei came up to the boat but it is imposs to express their confus when thei found the boat fast aground in the creek the tide eb out and their two men gone we could hear them call on to anoth in a most lament manner tell on anoth thei were got into an enchant island that either there were inhabit in it and thei should all be murder or els there were devil and spirit in it and thei should be all carri awai and devour thei halloo again and call their two comrad by their name a great mani time but no answer after some time we could see them by the littl light there wa run about wring their hand like men in despair and sometim thei would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselv then come ashor again and walk about again and so the same thing over again my men would fain have had me give them leav to fall upon them at onc in the dark but i wa will to take them at some advantag so as to spare them and kill as few of them as i could and especi i wa unwil to hazard the kill of ani of our men know the other were veri well arm i resolv to wait to see if thei did not separ and therefor to make sure of them i drew my ambuscad nearer and order fridai and the captain to creep upon their hand and feet as close to the ground as thei could that thei might not be discov and get as near them as thei could possibl befor thei offer to fire thei had not been long in that postur when the boatswain who wa the princip ringlead of the mutini and had now shown himself the most deject and dispirit of all the rest came walk toward them with two more of the crew the captain wa so eager at have thi princip rogu so much in hi power that he could hardli have patienc to let him come so near as to be sure of him for thei onli heard hi tongu befor but when thei came nearer the captain and fridai start up on their feet let fly at them the boatswain wa kill upon the spot the next man wa shot in the bodi and fell just by him though he did not die till an hour or two after and the third ran for it at the nois of the fire i immedi advanc with my whole armi which wa now eight men viz myself generalissimo fridai my lieuten gener the captain and hi two men and the three prison of war whom we had trust with arm we came upon them inde in the dark so that thei could not see our number and i made the man thei had left in the boat who wa now on of us to call them by name to try if i could bring them to a parlei and so perhap might reduc them to term which fell out just as we desir for inde it wa easi to think as their condit then wa thei would be veri will to capitul so he call out as loud as he could to on of them tom smith tom smith tom smith answer immedi is that robinson for it seem he knew the voic the other answer ay ay for god s sake tom smith throw down your arm and yield or you ar all dead men thi moment who must we yield to where ar thei sai smith again here thei ar sai he here s our captain and fifti men with him have been hunt you these two hour the boatswain is kill will fry is wound and i am a prison and if you do not yield you ar all lost will thei give us quarter then sai tom smith and we will yield i ll go and ask if you promis to yield said robinson so he ask the captain and the captain himself then call out you smith you know my voic if you lai down your arm immedi and submit you shall have your live all but will atkin upon thi will atkin cri out for god s sake captain give me quarter what have i done thei have all been as bad as i which by the wai wa not true for it seem thi will atkin wa the first man that laid hold of the captain when thei first mutini and us him barbar in ty hi hand and give him injuri languag howev the captain told him he must lai down hi arm at discret and trust to the governor s merci by which he meant me for thei all call me governor in a word thei all laid down their arm and beg their live and i sent the man that had parlei with them and two more who bound them all and then my great armi of fifti men which with those three were in all but eight came up and seiz upon them and upon their boat onli that i kept myself and on more out of sight for reason of state our next work wa to repair the boat and think of seiz the ship and as for the captain now he had leisur to parlei with them he expostul with them upon the villaini of their practic with him and upon the further wicked of their design and how certainli it must bring them to miseri and distress in the end and perhap to the gallow thei all appear veri penit and beg hard for their live as for that he told them thei were not hi prison but the command s of the island that thei thought thei had set him on shore in a barren uninhabit island but it had pleas god so to direct them that it wa inhabit and that the governor wa an englishman that he might hang them all there if he pleas but as he had given them all quarter he suppos he would send them to england to be dealt with there as justic requir except atkin whom he wa command by the governor to advis to prepar for death for that he would be hang in the morn though thi wa all but a fiction of hi own yet it had it desir effect atkin fell upon hi knee to beg the captain to interced with the governor for hi life and all the rest beg of him for god s sake that thei might not be sent to england it now occur to me that the time of our deliver wa come and that it would be a most easi thing to bring these fellow in to be hearti in get possess of the ship so i retir in the dark from them that thei might not see what kind of a governor thei had and call the captain to me when i call at a good distanc on of the men wa order to speak again and sai to the captain captain the command call for you and present the captain repli tell hi excel i am just come thi more perfectli amaz them and thei all believ that the command wa just by with hi fifti men upon the captain come to me i told him my project for seiz the ship which he like wonderfulli well and resolv to put it in execut the next morn but in order to execut it with more art and to be secur of success i told him we must divid the prison and that he should go and take atkin and two more of the worst of them and send them pinion to the cave where the other lai thi wa commit to fridai and the two men who came on shore with the captain thei convei them to the cave as to a prison and it wa inde a dismal place especi to men in their condit the other i order to my bower as i call it of which i have given a full descript and as it wa fenc in and thei pinion the place wa secur enough consid thei were upon their behaviour to these in the morn i sent the captain who wa to enter into a parlei with them in a word to try them and tell me whether he thought thei might be trust or not to go on board and surpris the ship he talk to them of the injuri done him of the condit thei were brought to and that though the governor had given them quarter for their live as to the present action yet that if thei were sent to england thei would all be hang in chain but that if thei would join in so just an attempt as to recov the ship he would have the governor s engag for their pardon ani on mai guess how readili such a propos would be accept by men in their condit thei fell down on their knee to the captain and promis with the deepest imprec that thei would be faith to him to the last drop and that thei should ow their live to him and would go with him all over the world that thei would own him as a father to them as long as thei live well sai the captain i must go and tell the governor what you sai and see what i can do to bring him to consent to it so he brought me an account of the temper he found them in and that he verili believ thei would be faith howev that we might be veri secur i told him he should go back again and choos out those five and tell them that thei might see he did not want men that he would take out those five to be hi assist and that the governor would keep the other two and the three that were sent prison to the castl my cave as hostag for the fidel of those five and that if thei prove unfaith in the execut the five hostag should be hang in chain aliv on the shore thi look sever and convinc them that the governor wa in earnest howev thei had no wai left them but to accept it and it wa now the busi of the

taken me in hi arm i held fast by him or i should have fallen to the ground he perceiv the surpris and immedi pull a bottl out of hi pocket and gave me a dram of cordial which he had brought on purpos for me after i had drunk it i sat down upon the ground and though it brought me to myself yet it wa a good while befor i could speak a word to him all thi time the poor man wa in as great an ecstasi as i onli not under ani surpris as i wa and he said a thousand kind and tender thing to me to compos and bring me to myself but such wa the flood of joi in my breast that it put all my spirit into confus at last it broke out into tear and in a littl while after i recov my speech i then took my turn and embrac him as my deliver and we rejoic togeth i told him i look upon him as a man sent by heaven to deliv me and that the whole transact seem to be a chain of wonder that such thing as these were the testimoni we had of a secret hand of provid govern the world and an evid that the ey of an infinit power could search into the remotest corner of the world and send help to the miser whenev he pleas i forgot not to lift up my heart in thank to heaven and what heart could forbear to bless him who had not onli in a miracul manner provid for me in such a wilder and in such a desol condit but from whom everi deliver must alwai be acknowledg to proce when we had talk a while the captain told me he had brought me some littl refresh such as the ship afford and such as the wretch that had been so long hi master had not plunder him of upon thi he call aloud to the boat and bade hi men bring the thing ashor that were for the governor and inde it wa a present as if i had been on that wa not to be carri awai with them but as if i had been to dwell upon the island still first he had

done with the prison we had for it wa worth consid whether we might ventur to take them with us or no especi two of them whom he knew to be incorrig and refractori to the last degre and the captain said he knew thei were such rogu that there wa no oblig them and if he did carri them awai it must be in iron as malefactor to be deliv over to justic at the first english coloni he could come to and i found that the captain himself wa veri anxiou about it upon thi i told him that if he desir it i would undertak to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request that he should leav them upon the island i should be veri glad of that sai the captain with all my heart well sai i i will send for them up and talk with them for you so i caus fridai and the two hostag for thei were now

them i knew not what merci to show them for as for myself i had resolv to quit the island with all my men and had taken passag with the captain to go to england and as for the captain he could not carri them to england other than as prison in iron to be tri for mutini and run awai with the ship the consequ of which thei must need know would be the gallow so that i could not tell what wa best for them unless thei had a mind to take their fate in the island if thei desir that as i had liberti to leav the island i had some inclin to give them their live if thei thought thei could shift on

i had di upon the spot nai after that i continu veri ill and wa so some hour till a physician be sent for and someth of the real caus of my ill be known he order me to be let blood after which i had relief and grew well but i verili believ if i had not been eas by a vent given in that manner to the spirit i should have di i wa now master all on a sudden of abov five thousand pound sterl in monei and had an estat as i might well call it in the brazil of abov a thousand pound a year as sure as an estat of land in england and in a word i wa in a condit which i scarc knew how to understand or how to compos myself for the enjoy of it the first thing i did wa to recompens my origin benefactor my good old captain who had been first charit to me in my distress kind to me in my begin and honest to me at the end i show him all that wa sent to me i told him that next to the provid of heaven which dispos all thing it wa ow to him and that it now lai on me to reward him which i would do a hundr

upon my head now than i had in my state of life in the island where i want noth but what i had and had noth but what i want wherea i had now a great charg upon me and my busi wa how to secur it i had not a cave now to hide my monei in or a place where it might lie without lock or kei till it grew mouldi and tarnish befor anybodi would meddl with it on the contrari i knew not where to put it or whom to trust with it my old patron the captain inde wa honest and that wa the onli refug i had in the next place my interest in the brazil seem to summon me thither but now i could not tell how to think of go thither till i had settl my affair and left my effect in some safe hand behind me at first i thought of my old friend the widow who i knew wa honest and would be just to me but then she wa in year and but poor and for aught i knew might be in debt so that in a word i had no wai but to go back to england myself and take my effect with me it wa some month howev befor i resolv upon thi and therefor as i had reward the old captain fulli and to hi satisfact who had been my former benefactor so i began to think of the poor widow whose husband had been my first benefactor and she while it wa in her power my faith steward and instructor so the first thing i did i got a merchant in lisbon to write to hi correspond in london not onli to pai a bill but to go find her out and carri her in monei a hundr pound from me and to talk with her and comfort her in her poverti by tell her she should if i live have a further suppli at the same time i sent my two sister in the countri a hundr pound each thei be though not in want yet not in veri good circumst on have been marri and left a widow and the other have a husband not so kind to her as he should be but among all my relat or acquaint i could not yet pitch upon on to whom i durst commit the gross of my stock that i might go awai to the brazil and leav thing safe behind me and thi greatli perplex me i had onc a mind to have gone to the brazil and have settl myself there for i wa as it were naturalis to the place but i had some littl scrupl in my mind about religion which insens drew me back howev it wa not religion that kept me from go there for the present and as i had made no scrupl of be openli of the religion of the countri all the while i wa among them so neither did i yet onli that now and then have of late thought more of it than formerli when i began to think of live and dy among them i began to regret have profess myself a papist and thought it might not be the best religion to die with but as i have said thi wa not the main thing that kept me from go to the brazil but that realli i did not know with whom to leav my effect behind me so i resolv at last to go to england where if i arriv i conclud that i should make some acquaint or find some relat that would be faith to me and accordingli i prepar to go to england with all my wealth in order to prepar thing for my go home i first the brazil fleet be just go awai resolv to give answer suitabl to the just and faith account of thing i had from thenc and first to the prior of st augustin i wrote a letter full of thank for hi just deal and the offer of the eight hundr and seventi two moidor which were undispos of which i desir might be given five hundr to the monasteri and three hundr and seventi two to the poor as the prior should direct desir the good padr s prayer for me and the like i wrote next a letter of thank to my two truste with all the acknowledg that so much justic and honesti call for as for send them ani present thei were far abov have ani occas of it lastli i wrote to my partner acknowledg hi industri in the improv the plantat and hi integr in increas the stock of the work give him instruct for hi futur govern of my part accord to the power i had left with my old patron to whom i desir him to send whatev becam due to me till he should hear from me more particularli assur him that it wa my intent not onli to come to him but to settl myself there for the remaind of my life to thi i ad a veri handsom present of some italian silk for hi wife and two daughter for such the captain s son inform me he had with two piec of fine english broadcloth the best i could get in lisbon five piec of black baiz and some flander lace of a good valu have thu settl my affair sold my cargo and turn all my effect into good bill of exchang my next difficulti wa which wai to go to england i had been accustom enough to the sea and yet i had a strang avers to go to england by the sea at that time and yet i could give no reason for it yet the difficulti increas upon me so much that though i had onc ship my baggag in order to go yet i alter my mind and that not onc but two or three time it is true i had been veri unfortun by sea and thi might be on of the reason but let no man slight the strong impuls of hi own thought in case of such moment two of the ship which i had singl out to go in i mean more particularli singl out than ani other have put my thing on board on of them and in the other have agre with the captain i sai two of these ship miscarri on wa taken by the algerin and the other wa lost on the start near torbai and all the peopl drown except three so that in either of those vessel i had been made miser have been thu harass in my thought my old pilot to whom i commun everyth press me earnestli not to go by sea but either to go by land to the groyn and cross over the bai of biscai to rochel from whenc it wa but an easi and safe journei by land to pari and so to calai and dover or to go up to madrid and so all the wai by land through franc in a word i wa so prepossess against my go by sea at all except from calai to dover that i resolv to travel all the wai by land which as i wa not in hast and did not valu the charg wa by much the pleasant wai and to make it more so my old captain brought an english gentleman the son of a merchant in lisbon who wa will to travel with me after which we pick up two more english merchant also and two young portugues gentlemen the last go to pari onli so that in all there were six of us and five servant the two merchant and the two portugues content themselv with on servant between two to save the charg and as for me i got an english sailor to travel with me as a servant besid my man fridai who wa too much a stranger to be capabl of suppli the place of a servant on the road in thi manner i set out from lisbon and our compani be veri well mount and arm we made a littl troop whereof thei did me the honour to call me captain as well becaus i wa the oldest man as becaus i had two servant and inde wa the origin of the whole journei as i have troubl you with none of my sea journal so i shall troubl you now with none of my land journal but some adventur that happen to us in thi tediou and difficult journei i must not omit when we came to madrid we be all of us stranger to spain were will to stai some time to see the court of spain and what wa worth observ but it be the latter part of the summer we hasten awai and set out from madrid about the middl of octob but when we came to the edg of navarr we were alarm at sever town on the wai with an account that so much snow wa fall on the french side of the mountain that sever travel were oblig to come back to pampeluna after have attempt at an extrem hazard to pass on when we came to pampeluna itself we found it so inde and to me that had been alwai us to a hot climat and to countri where i could scarc bear ani cloth on the cold wa insuffer nor inde wa it more pain than surpris to come but ten dai befor out of old castil where the weather wa not onli warm but veri hot and immedi to feel a wind from the pyrenean mountain so veri keen so sever cold as to be intoler and to endang benumb and perish of our finger and toe poor fridai wa realli frighten when he saw the mountain all cover with snow and felt cold weather which he had never seen or felt befor in hi life to mend the matter when we came to pampeluna it continu snow with so much violenc and so long that the peopl said winter wa come befor it time and the road which were difficult befor were now quit impass for in a word the snow lai in some place too thick for us to travel and be not hard frozen as is the case in the northern countri there wa no go without be in danger of be buri aliv everi step we stai no less than twenti dai at pampeluna when see the winter come on and no likelihood of it be better for it wa the severest winter all over europ that had been known in the memori of man i propos that we should go awai to fontarabia and there take ship for bordeaux which wa a veri littl voyag but while i wa consid thi there came in four french gentlemen who have been stop on the french side of the pass as we were on the spanish had found out a guid who travers the countri near the head of languedoc had brought them over the mountain by such wai that thei were not much incommod with the snow for where thei met with snow in ani quantiti thei said it wa frozen hard enough to bear them and their hors we sent for thi guid who told us he would undertak to carri us the same wai with no hazard from the snow provid we were arm suffici to protect ourselv from wild beast for he said in these great snow it wa frequent for some wolv to show themselv at the foot of the mountain be made raven for want of food the ground be cover with snow we told him we were well enough prepar for such creatur as thei were if he would insur us from a kind of two leg wolv which we were told we were in most danger from especi on the french side of the mountain he satisfi us that there wa no danger of that kind in the wai that we were to go so we readili agre to follow him as did also twelv other gentlemen with their servant some french some spanish who as i said had attempt to go and were oblig to come back again accordingli we set out from pampeluna with our guid on the th of novemb and inde i wa surpris when instead of go forward he came directli back with us on the same road that we came from madrid about twenti mile when have pass two river and come into the plain countri we found ourselv in a warm climat again where the countri wa pleasant and no snow to be seen but on a sudden turn to hi left he approach the mountain anoth wai and though it is true the hill and precipic look dread yet he made so mani tour such meander and led us by such wind wai that we insens pass the height of the mountain without be much encumb with the snow and all on a sudden he show us the pleasant and fruit provinc of languedoc and gasconi all green and flourish though at a great distanc and we had some rough wai to pass still we were a littl uneasi howev when we found it snow on whole dai and a night so fast that we could not travel but he bid us be easi we should soon be past it all we found inde that we began to descend everi dai and to come more north than befor and so depend upon our guid we went on it wa about two hour befor night when our guid be someth befor us and not just in sight out rush three monstrou wolv and after them a bear from a hollow wai adjoin to a thick wood two of the wolv made at the guid and had he been far befor us he would have been devour befor we could have help him on of them fasten upon hi hors and the other attack the man with such violenc that he had not time or presenc of mind enough to draw hi pistol but halloo and cri out to us most lustili my man fridai be next me i bade him ride up and see what wa the matter as soon as fridai came in sight of the man he halloo out as loud as the other o master o master but like a bold fellow rode directli up to the poor man and with hi pistol shot the wolf in the head that attack him it wa happi for the poor man that it wa my man fridai for have been us to such creatur in hi countri he had no fear upon him but went close up to him and shot him wherea ani other of us would have fire at a farther distanc and have perhap either miss the wolf or endang shoot the man but it wa enough to have terrifi a bolder man than i and inde it alarm all our compani when with the nois of fridai s pistol we heard on both side the most dismal howl of wolv and the nois redoubl by the echo of the mountain appear to us as if there had been a prodigi number of them and perhap there wa not such a few as that we had no caus of apprehens howev as fridai had kill thi wolf the other that had fasten upon the hors left him immedi and fled without do him ani damag have happili fasten upon hi head where the boss of the bridl had stuck in hi teeth but the man wa most hurt for the rage creatur had bit him twice onc in the arm and the other time a littl abov hi knee and though he had made some defenc he wa just tumbl down by the disord of hi hors when fridai came up and shot the wolf it is easi to suppos that at the nois of fridai s pistol we all mend our pace and rode up as fast as the wai which wa veri difficult would give us leav to see what wa the matter as soon as we came clear of the tree which blind us befor we saw clearli what had been the case and how fridai had disengag the poor guid though we did not present discern what kind of creatur it wa he had kill chapter xx fight between fridai and a bear but never wa a fight manag so hardili and in such a surpris manner as that which follow between fridai and the bear which gave us all though at first we were surpris and afraid for him the greatest divers imagin as the bear is a heavi clumsi creatur and doe not gallop as the wolf doe who is swift and light so he ha two particular qualiti which gener ar the rule of hi action first as to men who ar not hi proper prei he doe not usual attempt them except thei first attack him unless he be excess hungri which it is probabl might now be the case the ground be cover with snow if you do not meddl with him he will not meddl with you but then you must take care to be veri civil to him and give him the road for he is a veri nice gentleman he will not go a step out of hi wai for a princ nai if you ar realli afraid your best wai is to look anoth wai and keep go on for sometim if you stop and stand still and look steadfastli at him he take it for an affront but if you throw or toss anyth at him though it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger he think himself abus and set all other busi asid to pursu hi reveng and will have satisfact in point of honour that is hi first qualiti the next is if he be onc affront he will never leav you night or dai till he ha hi reveng but follow at a good round rate till he overtak you my man fridai had deliv our guid and when we came up to him he wa help him off hi hors for the man wa both hurt and frighten when on a sudden we espi the bear come out of the wood and a monstrou on it wa the biggest by far that ever i saw we were all a littl surpris when we saw him but when fridai saw him it wa easi to see joi and courag in the fellow s counten o o o sai fridai three time point to him o master you give me te leav me shake te hand with him me make you good laugh i wa surpris to see the fellow so well pleas you fool sai i he will eat you up eate me up eate me up sai fridai twice over again me eate him up me make you good laugh you all stai here me show you good laugh so down he sit and get off hi boot in a moment and put on a pair of pump as we call the flat shoe thei wear and which he had in hi pocket give my other servant hi hors and with hi gun awai he flew swift like the wind the bear wa walk softli on and offer to meddl with nobodi till fridai come pretti near call to him as if the bear could understand him hark ye hark ye sai fridai me speake with you we follow at a distanc for now be down on the gasconi side of the mountain we were enter a vast forest where the countri wa plain and pretti open though it had mani tree in it scatter here and there fridai who had as we sai the heel of the bear came up with him quickli and took up a great stone and threw it at him and hit him just on the head but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against a wall but it answer fridai s end for the rogu wa so void of fear that he did it pure to make the bear follow him and show us some laugh as he call it as soon as the bear felt the blow and saw him he turn about and come after him take veri long stride and shuffl on at a strang rate so as would have put a hors to a middl gallop awai rein fridai and take hi cours as if he ran toward us for help so we all resolv to fire at onc upon the bear and deliv my man though i wa angri at him for bring the bear back upon us when he wa go about hi own busi anoth wai and especi i wa angri that he had turn the bear upon us and then ran awai and i call out you dog is thi your make us laugh come awai and take your hors that we mai shoot the creatur he heard me and cri out no shoot no shoot stand still and you get much laugh and as the nimbl creatur ran two feet for the bear s on he turn on a sudden on on side of us and see a great oak tree fit for hi purpos he beckon to us to follow and doubl hi pace he got nimbl up the tree lai hi gun down upon the ground at about five or six yard from the bottom of the tree the bear soon came to the tree and we follow at a distanc the first thing he did he stop at the gun smelt at it but let it lie and up he scrambl into the tree climb like a cat though so monstrou heavi i wa amaz at the folli as i thought it of my man and could not for my life see anyth to laugh at till see the bear get up the tree we all rode near to him when we came to the tree there wa fridai got out to the small end of a larg branch and the bear got about half wai to him as soon as the bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree wa weaker ha sai he to us now you see me teache the bear danc so he began jump and shake the bough at which the bear began to totter but stood still and began to look behind him to see how he should get back then inde we did laugh heartili but fridai had not done with him by a great deal when see him stand still he call out to him again as if he had suppos the bear could speak english what you come no farther prai you come farther so he left jump and shake the tree and the bear just as if he understood what he said did come a littl farther then he began jump again and the bear stop again we thought now wa a good time to knock him in the head and call to fridai to stand still and we should shoot the bear but he cri out earnestli oh prai oh prai no shoot me shoot by and then he would have said by and by howev to shorten the stori fridai danc so much and the bear stood so ticklish that we had laugh enough but still could not imagin what the fellow would do for first we thought he depend upon shake the bear off and we found the bear wa too cun for that too for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down but clung fast with hi great broad claw and feet so that we could not imagin what would be the end of it and what the jest would be at last but fridai put us out of doubt quickli for see the bear cling fast to the bough and that he would not be persuad to come ani farther well well sai fridai you no come farther me go you no come to me me come to you and upon thi he went out to the smaller end where it would bend with hi weight and gentli let himself down by it slide down the bough till he came near enough to jump down on hi feet and awai he ran to hi gun took it up and stood still well said i to him fridai what will you do now why don t you shoot him no shoot sai fridai no yet me shoot now me no kill me stai give you on more laugh and inde so he did for when the bear saw hi enemi gone he came back from the bough where he stood but did it veri cautious look behind him everi step and come backward till he got into the bodi of the tree then with the same hinder end foremost he came down the tree grasp it with hi claw and move on foot at a time veri leisur at thi junctur and just befor he could set hi hind foot on the ground fridai step up close to him clap the muzzl of hi piec into hi ear and shot him dead then the rogu turn about to see if we did not laugh and when he saw we were pleas by our look he began to laugh veri loud so we kill bear in my countri sai fridai so you kill them sai i why you have no gun no sai he no gun but shoot great much long arrow thi wa a good divers to us but we were still in a wild place and our guid veri much hurt and what to do we hardli knew the howl of wolv ran much in my head and inde except the nois i onc heard on the shore of africa of which i have said someth alreadi i never heard anyth that fill me with so much horror these thing and the approach of night call us off or els as fridai would have had us we should certainli have taken the skin of thi monstrou creatur off which wa worth save but we had near three leagu to go and our guid hasten us so we left him and went forward on our journei the ground wa still cover with snow though not so deep and danger as on the mountain and the raven creatur as we heard afterward were come down into the forest and plain countri press by hunger to seek for food and had done a great deal of mischief in the villag where thei surpris the countri peopl kill a great mani of their sheep and hors and some peopl too we had on danger place to pass and our guid told us if there were more wolv in the countri we should find them there and thi wa a small plain surround with wood on everi side and a long narrow defil or lane which we were to pass to get through the wood and then we should come to the villag where we were to lodg it wa within half an hour of sunset when we enter the wood and a littl after sunset when we came into the plain we met with noth in the first wood except that in a littl plain within the wood which wa not abov two furlong over we saw five great wolv cross the road full speed on after anoth as if thei had been in chase of some prei and had it in view thei took no notic of us and were gone out of sight in a few moment upon thi our guid who by the wai wa but a faintheart fellow bid us keep in a readi postur for he believ there were more wolv a come we kept our arm readi and our ey about us but we saw no more wolv till we came through that wood which wa near half a leagu and enter the plain as soon as we came into the plain we had occas enough to look about us the first object we met with wa a dead hors that is to sai a poor hors which the wolv had kill and at least a dozen of them at work we could not sai eat him but pick hi bone rather for thei had eaten up all the flesh befor we did not think fit to disturb them at their feast neither did thei take much notic of us fridai would have let fly at them but i would not suffer him by ani mean for i found we were like to have more busi upon our hand than we were awar of we had not gone half over the plain when we began to hear the wolv howl in the wood on our left in a fright manner and present after we saw about a hundr come on directli toward us all in a bodi and most of them in a line as regularli as an armi drawn up by experienc offic i scarc knew in what manner to receiv them but found to draw ourselv in a close line wa the onli wai so we form in a moment but that we might not have too much interv i order that onli everi other man should fire and that the other who had not fire should stand readi to give them a second vollei immedi if thei continu to advanc upon us and then that those that had fire at first should not pretend to load their fuse again but stand readi everi on with a pistol for we were all arm with a fuse and a pair of pistol each man so we were by thi method abl to fire six vollei half of us at a time howev at present we had no necess for upon fire the first vollei the enemi made a full stop be terrifi as well with the nois as with the fire four of them be shot in the head drop sever other were wound and went bleed off as we could see by the snow i found thei stop but did not immedi retreat whereupon rememb that i had been told that the fiercest creatur were terrifi at the voic of a man i caus all the compani to halloo as loud as thei could and i found the notion not altogeth mistaken for upon our shout thei began to retir and turn about i then order a second vollei to be fire in their rear which put them to the gallop and awai thei went to the wood thi gave us leisur to charg our piec again and that we might lose no time we kept go but we had but littl more than load our fuse and put ourselv in readi when we heard a terribl nois in the same wood on our left onli that it wa farther onward the same wai we were to go the night wa come on and the light began to be duski which made it wors on our side but the nois increas we could easili perceiv that it wa the howl and yell of those hellish creatur and on a sudden we perceiv three troop of wolv on on our left on behind us and on in our front so that we seem to be surround with them howev as thei did not fall upon us we kept our wai forward as fast as we could make our hors go which the wai be veri rough wa onli a good hard trot in thi manner we came in view of the entranc of a wood through which we were to pass at the farther side of the plain but we were greatli surpris when come nearer the lane or pass we saw a confus number of wolv stand just at the entranc on a sudden at anoth open of the wood we heard the nois of a gun and look that wai out rush a hors with a saddl and a bridl on him fly like the wind and sixteen or seventeen wolv after him full speed the hors had the advantag of them but as we suppos that he could not hold it at that rate we doubt not but thei would get up with him at last no question but thei did but here we had a most horribl sight for ride up to the entranc where the hors came out we found the carcass of anoth hors and of two men devour by the raven creatur and on of the men wa no doubt the same whom we heard fire the gun for there lai a gun just by him fire off but as to the man hi head and the upper part of hi bodi wa eaten up thi fill us with horror and we knew not what cours to take but the creatur resolv us soon for thei gather about us present in hope of prei and i verili believ there were three hundr of them it happen veri much to our advantag that at the entranc into the wood but a littl wai from it there lai some larg timber tree which had been cut down the summer befor and i suppos lai there for carriag i drew my littl troop in among those tree and place ourselv in a line behind on long tree i advis them all to alight and keep that tree befor us for a breastwork to stand in a triangl or three front enclos our hors in the centr we did so and it wa well we did for never wa a more furiou charg than the creatur made upon us in thi place thei came on with a growl kind of nois and mount the piec of timber which as i said wa our breastwork as if thei were onli rush upon their prei and thi furi of their it seem wa princip occas by their see our hors behind us i order our men to fire as befor everi other man and thei took their aim so sure that thei kill sever of the wolv at the first vollei but there wa a necess to keep a continu fire for thei came on like devil those behind push on those befor when we had fire a second vollei of our fuse we thought thei stop a littl and i hope thei would have gone off but it wa but a moment for other came forward again so we fire two vollei of our pistol and i believ in these four fire we had kill seventeen or eighteen of them and lame twice as mani yet thei came on again i wa loth to spend our shot too hastili so i call my servant not my man fridai for he wa better emploi for with the greatest dexter imagin he had charg my fuse and hi own while we were engag but as i said i call my other man and give him a horn of powder i had him lai a train all along the piec of timber and let it be a larg train he did so and had but just time to get awai when the wolv came up to it and some got upon it when i snap an unchang pistol close to the powder set it on fire those that were upon the timber were scorch with it and six or seven of them fell or rather jump in among us with the forc and fright of the fire we despatch these in an instant and the rest were so frighten with the light which the night for it wa now veri near dark made more terribl that thei drew back a littl upon which i order our last pistol to be fire off in on vollei and after that we gave a shout upon thi the wolv turn tail and we salli immedi upon near twenti lame on that we found struggl on the ground and fell to cut them with our sword which answer our expect for the cry and howl thei made wa better understood by their fellow so that thei all fled and left us we had first and last kill about threescor of them and had it been daylight we had kill mani more the field of battl be thu clear we made forward again for we had still near a leagu to go we heard the raven creatur howl and yell in the wood as we went sever time and sometim we fanci we saw some of them but the snow dazzl our ey we were not certain in about an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodg which we found in a terribl fright and all in arm for it seem the night befor the wolv and some bear had broken into the villag and put them in such terror that thei were oblig to keep guard night and dai but especi in the night to preserv their cattl and inde their peopl the next morn our guid wa so ill and hi limb swell so much with the rankl of hi two wound that he could go no farther so we were oblig to take a new guid here and go to toulous where we found a warm climat a fruit pleasant countri and no snow no wolv nor anyth like them but when we told our stori at toulous thei told us it wa noth but what wa ordinari in the great forest at the foot of the mountain especi when the snow lai on the ground but thei inquir much what kind of guid we had got who would ventur to bring us that wai in such a sever season and told us it wa surpris we were not all devour when we told them how we place ourselv and the hors in the middl thei blame us exceedingli and told us it wa fifti to on but we had been all destroi for it wa the sight of the hors which made the wolv so furiou see their prei and that at other time thei ar realli afraid of a gun but be excess hungri and rage on that account the eager to come at the hors had made them senseless of danger and that if we had not by the continu fire and at last by the stratagem of the train of powder master them it had been great odd but that we had been torn to piec wherea had we been content to have sat still on horseback and fire as horsemen thei would not have taken the hors so much for their own when men were on their back as otherwis and withal thei told us that at last if we had stood altogeth and left our hors thei would have been so eager to have devour them that we might have come off safe especi have our firearm in our hand be so mani in number for my part i wa never so sensibl of danger in my life for see abov three hundr devil come roar and open mouth to devour us and have noth to shelter us or retreat to i gave myself over for lost and as it wa i believ i shall never care to cross those mountain again i think i would much rather go a thousand leagu by sea though i wa sure to meet with a storm onc a week i have noth uncommon to take notic of in my passag through franc noth but what other travel have given an account of with much more advantag than i can i travel from toulous to pari and without ani consider stai came to calai and land safe at dover the th of januari after have had a sever cold season to travel in i wa now come to the centr of my travel and had in a littl time all my new discov estat safe about me the bill of exchang which i brought with me have been current paid my princip
