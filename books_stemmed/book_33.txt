hi usual melancholi tavern and have read all the newspap and beguil the rest of the even with hi banker s book went home to bed he live in chamber which had onc belong to hi deceas partner thei were a gloomi suit of room in a lower pile of build up a yard where it had so littl busi to be that on could scarc help fanci it must have run there when it wa a young hous plai at hide and seek with other hous and forgotten the wai out again it wa old enough now and dreari enough for nobodi live in it but scroog the other room be all let out as offic the yard wa so dark that even scroog who knew it everi stone wa fain to grope with hi hand the fog and frost so hung about the black old gatewai of the hous that it seem as if the geniu of the weather sat in mourn medit on the threshold now it is a fact that there wa noth at all particular about the knocker on the door except that it wa veri larg it is also a fact that scroog had seen it night and morn dure hi whole resid in that place also that scroog had as littl of what is call fanci about him as ani man in the citi of london even includ which is a bold word the corpor aldermen and liveri let it also be born in mind that scroog had not bestow on thought on marlei sinc hi last mention of hi seven year dead partner that afternoon and then let ani man explain to me if he can how it happen that scroog have hi kei in the lock of the door saw in the knocker without it undergo ani intermedi process of chang not a knocker but marlei s face marlei s face it wa not in impenetr shadow as the other object in the yard were but had a dismal light about it like a bad lobster in a dark cellar it wa not angri or feroci but look at scroog as marlei us to look with ghostli spectacl turn up on it ghostli forehead the hair wa curious stir as if by breath or hot air and though the ey were wide open thei were perfectli motionless that and it livid colour made it horribl but it horror seem to be in spite of the face and beyond it control rather than a part of it own express as scroog look fixedli at thi phenomenon it wa a knocker again to sai that he wa not startl or that hi blood wa not consciou of a terribl sensat to which it had been a stranger from infanc would be untru but he put hi hand upon the kei he had relinquish turn it sturdili walk in and light hi candl he did paus with a moment s irresolut befor he shut the door and he did look cautious behind it first as if he half expect to be terrifi with the sight of marlei s pigtail stick out into the hall but there wa noth on the back of the door except the screw and nut that held the knocker on so he said pooh pooh and close it with a bang the sound resound through the hous like thunder everi room abov and everi cask in the wine merchant s cellar below appear to have a separ peal of echo of it own scroog wa not a man to be frighten by echo he fasten the door and walk across the hall and up the stair slowli too trim hi candl as he went you mai talk vagu about drive a coach and six up a good old flight of stair or through a bad young act of parliament but i mean to sai you might have got a hears up that staircas and taken it broadwis with the splinter bar toward the wall and the door toward the balustrad and done it easi there wa plenti of width for that and room to spare which is perhap the reason why scroog thought he saw a locomot hears go on befor him in the gloom half a dozen ga lamp out of the street wouldn t have light the entri too well so you mai suppos that it wa pretti dark with scroog s dip up scroog went not care a button for that dark is cheap and scroog like it but befor he shut hi heavi door he walk through hi room to see that all wa right he had just enough recollect of the face to desir to do that sit room bedroom lumber room all as thei should be nobodi under the tabl nobodi under the sofa a small fire in the grate spoon and basin readi and the littl saucepan of gruel scroog had a cold in hi head upon the hob nobodi under the bed nobodi in the closet nobodi in hi dress gown which wa hang up in a suspici attitud against the wall lumber room as usual old fire guard old shoe two fish basket wash stand on three leg and a poker quit satisfi he close hi door and lock himself in doubl lock himself in which wa not hi custom thu secur against surpris he took off hi cravat put on hi dress gown and slipper and hi nightcap and sat down befor the fire to take hi gruel it wa a veri low fire inde noth on such a bitter night he wa oblig to sit close to it and brood over it befor he could extract the least sensat of warmth from such a hand of fuel the fireplac wa an old on built by some dutch merchant long ago and pave all round with quaint dutch tile design to illustr the scriptur there were cain and abel pharaoh s daughter queen of sheba angel messeng descend through the air on cloud like feather bed abraham belshazzar apostl put off to sea in butter boat hundr of figur to attract hi thought and yet that face of marlei seven year dead came like the ancient prophet s rod and swallow up the whole if each smooth tile had been a blank at first with power to shape some pictur on it surfac from the disjoint fragment of hi thought there would have been a copi of old marlei s head on everi on humbug said scroog and walk across the room after sever turn he sat down again as he threw hi head back in the chair hi glanc happen to rest upon a bell a disus bell that hung in the room and commun for some purpos now forgotten with a chamber in the highest stori of the build it wa with great astonish and with a strang inexplic dread that as he look he saw thi bell begin to swing it swung so softli in the outset that it scarc made a sound but soon it rang out loudli and so did everi bell in the hous thi might have last half a minut or a minut but it seem an hour the bell ceas as thei had begun togeth thei were succeed by a clank nois deep down below as if some person were drag a heavi chain over the cask in the wine merchant s cellar scroog then rememb to have heard that ghost in haunt hous were describ as drag chain the cellar door flew open with a boom sound and then he heard the nois much louder on the floor below then come up the stair then come straight toward hi door it s humbug still said scroog i won t believ it hi colour chang though when without a paus it came on through the heavi door and pass into the room befor hi ey upon it come in the dy flame leap up as though it cri i know him marlei s ghost and fell again the same face the veri same marlei in hi pigtail usual waistcoat tight and boot the tassel on the latter bristl like hi pigtail and hi coat skirt and the hair upon hi head the chain he drew wa clasp about hi middl it wa long and wound about him like a tail and it wa made for scroog observ it close of cash box kei padlock ledger deed and heavi purs wrought in steel hi bodi wa transpar so that scroog observ him and look through hi waistcoat could see the two button on hi coat behind scroog had often heard it said that marlei had no bowel but he had never believ it until now no nor did he believ it even now though he look the phantom through and through and saw it stand befor him though he felt the chill influenc of it death cold ey and mark the veri textur of the fold kerchief bound about it head and chin which wrapper he had not observ befor he wa still incredul and fought against hi sens how now said scroog caustic and cold as ever what do you want with me much marlei s voic no doubt about it who ar you ask me who i wa who were you then said scroog rais hi voic you re particular for a shade he wa go to sai to a shade but substitut thi as more appropri in life i wa your partner jacob marlei can you can you sit down ask scroog look doubtfulli at him i can do it then scroog ask the question becaus he didn t know whether a ghost so transpar might find himself in a condit to take a chair and felt that in the event of it be imposs it might involv the necess of an embarrass explan but the ghost sat down on the opposit side of the fireplac as if he were quit us to it you don t believ in me observ the ghost i don t said scroog what evid would you have of my realiti beyond that of your sens i don t know said scroog why do you doubt your sens becaus said scroog a littl thing affect them a slight disord of the stomach make them cheat you mai be an undigest bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of chees a fragment of an underdon potato there s more of gravi than of grave about you whatev you ar scroog wa not much in the habit of crack joke nor did he feel in hi heart by ani mean waggish then the truth is that he tri to be smart as a mean of distract hi own attent and keep down hi terror for the spectr s voic disturb the veri marrow in hi bone to sit stare at those fix glaze ey in silenc for a moment would plai scroog felt the veri deuc with him there wa someth veri aw too in the spectr s be provid with an infern atmospher of it own scroog could not feel it himself but thi wa clearli the case for though the ghost sat perfectli motionless it hair and skirt and tassel were still agit as by the hot vapour from an oven you see thi toothpick said scroog return quickli to the charg for the reason just assign and wish though it were onli for a second to divert the vision s stoni gaze from himself i do repli the ghost you ar not look at it said scroog but i see it said the ghost notwithstand well return scroog i have but to swallow thi and be for the rest of my dai persecut by a legion of goblin all of my own creation humbug i tell you humbug at thi the spirit rais a fright cry and shook it chain with such a dismal and appal nois that scroog held on tight to hi chair to save himself from fall in a swoon but how much greater wa hi horror when the phantom take off the bandag round it head as if it were too warm to wear indoor it lower jaw drop down upon it breast scroog fell upon hi knee and clasp hi hand befor hi face merci he said dread apparit why do you troubl me man of the worldli mind repli the ghost do you believ in me or not i do said scroog i must but why do spirit walk the earth and why do thei come to me it is requir of everi man the ghost return that the spirit within him should walk abroad among hi fellowmen and travel far and wide and if that spirit goe not forth in life it is condemn to do so after death it is doom to wander through the world oh woe is me and wit what it cannot share but might have share on earth and turn to happi again the spectr rais a cry and shook it chain and wrung it shadowi hand you ar fetter said scroog trembl tell me why i wear the chain i forg in life repli the ghost i made it link by link and yard by yard i gird it on of my own free will and of my own free will i wore it is it pattern strang to you scroog trembl more and more or would you know pursu the ghost the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself it wa full as heavi and as long as thi seven christma ev ago you have labour on it sinc it is a ponder chain scroog glanc about him on the floor in the expect of find himself surround by some fifti or sixti fathom of iron cabl but he could see noth jacob he said imploringli old jacob marlei tell me more speak comfort to me jacob i have none to give the ghost repli it come from other region ebenez scroog and is convei by other

to see me no more and look that for your own sake you rememb what ha pass between us when it had said these word the spectr took it wrapper from the tabl and bound it round it head as befor scroog knew thi by the smart sound it teeth made when the jaw were brought togeth by the bandag he ventur to rais hi ey again and found hi supernatur visitor confront him in an erect attitud with it chain wound over and about it arm the apparit walk backward from him and at everi step it took the window rais itself a littl so that when the spectr reach it it wa wide open it beckon scroog to approach which he did when thei were within two pace of each other marlei s ghost held up it hand warn him to come no nearer scroog stop not so much in obedi as in surpris and fear for on the rais of the hand he becam sensibl of confus nois in the air incoher sound of lament and regret wail inexpress sorrow and self accusatori the spectr after listen for a moment join in the mourn dirg and float out upon

thei sought to interfer for good in human matter and had lost the power for ever whether these creatur fade into mist or mist enshroud them he could not tell but thei and their spirit voic fade togeth and the night becam as it had been when he walk home scroog close the window and examin the door by which the ghost had enter it wa doubl lock as he had lock it with hi own hand and the bolt were undisturb he tri to sai humbug but stop at the first syllabl and be from the emot he had undergon or the fatigu of the dai or hi glimps of the invis world or the dull convers of the ghost or the late

have been an affront to your understand and would instantli have sidl off in the direct of the plump sister she often cri out that it wasn t fair and it realli wa not but when at last he caught her when in spite of all her silken rustl and her rapid flutter past him he got her into a corner whenc there wa no escap then hi conduct wa the most execr for hi pretend not to know her hi pretend that it wa necessari to touch her head dress and further to assur himself of her ident by press a certain ring upon her finger and a certain chain about her neck wa vile monstrou no doubt she told him her

guess quit right too for the sharpest needl best whitechapel warrant not to cut in the ey wa not sharper than scroog blunt as he took it in hi head to be the ghost wa greatli pleas to find him in thi mood and look upon him with such favour that he beg like a boi to be allow to stai until the guest depart but thi the spirit said could not be done here is a new game said scroog on half hour spirit onli on it wa a game call ye and no where scroog s nephew had to think of someth and the rest must find out what he onli answer to their question ye or no as the case wa the brisk fire of question to
