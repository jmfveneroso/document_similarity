americans devour eagerly any piece of writing that purports to tell us the secret of success in life yet how often we are disappointed to find nothing but commonplace statements or receipts that we know by heart but never follow most of the life stories of our famous and successful men fail to inspire because they lack the human element that makes the record real and brings the story within our grasp while we are searching far and near for some aladdin s lamp to give coveted fortune there is ready at our hand if we will only reach out and take it like the charm in milton s comus unknown and like esteemed and the dull swain treads on it daily with his clouted shoon the interesting human and vividly told story of one of the wisest and most useful lives in our own history and perhaps in any history in franklin s autobiography is offered not so much a ready made formula for success as the companionship of a real flesh and blood man of extraordinary mind and quality whose daily walk and conversation will help us to meet our own difficulties much as does the example of a wise and strong friend while we are fascinated by the story we absorb the human experience through which a strong and helpful character is building the thing that makes franklin s autobiography different from every other life story of a great and successful man is just this human aspect of the account franklin told the story of his life as he himself says for the benefit of his posterity he wanted to help them by the relation of his own rise from obscurity and poverty to eminence and wealth he is not unmindful of the importance of his public services and their recognition yet his accounts of these achievements are given only as a part of the story and the vanity displayed is incidental and in keeping with the honesty of the recital there is nothing of the impossible in the method and practice of franklin as he sets them forth the youth who reads the fascinating story is astonished to find that franklin in his early years struggled with the same everyday passions and difficulties that he himself experiences and he loses the sense of discouragement that comes from a realization of his own shortcomings and inability to attain there are other reasons why the autobiography should be an intimate friend of american young people here they may establish a close relationship with one of the foremost americans as well as one of the wisest men of his age the life of benjamin franklin is of importance to every american primarily because of the part he played in securing the independence of the united states and in establishing it as a nation franklin shares with washington the honors of the revolution and of the events leading to the birth of the new nation while washington was the animating spirit of the struggle in the colonies franklin was its ablest champion abroad to franklin s cogent reasoning and keen satire we owe the clear and forcible presentation of the american case in england and france while to his personality and diplomacy as well as to his facile pen we are indebted for the foreign alliance and the funds without which washington s work must have failed his patience fortitude and practical wisdom coupled with self sacrificing devotion to the cause of his country are hardly less noticeable than similar qualities displayed by washington in fact franklin as a public man was much like washington especially in the entire disinterestedness of his public service franklin is also interesting to us because by his life and teachings he has done more than any other american to advance the material prosperity of his countrymen it is said that his widely and faithfully read maxims made philadelphia and pennsylvania wealthy while poor richard s pithy sayings translated into many languages have had a world wide influence franklin is a good type of our american manhood although not the wealthiest or the most powerful he is undoubtedly in the versatility of his genius and achievements the greatest of our self made men the simple yet graphic story in the autobiography of his steady rise from humble boyhood in a tallow chandler shop by industry economy and perseverance in self improvement to eminence is the most remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self made men it is in itself a wonderful illustration of the results possible to be attained in a land of unequaled opportunity by following franklin s maxims franklin s fame however was not confined to his own country although he lived in a century notable for the rapid evolution of scientific and political thought and activity yet no less a keen judge and critic than lord jeffrey the famous editor of the edinburgh review a century ago said that in one point of view the name of franklin must be considered as standing higher than any of the others which illustrated the eighteenth century distinguished as a statesman he was equally great as a philosopher thus uniting in himself a rare degree of excellence in both these pursuits to excel in either of which is deemed the highest praise franklin has indeed been aptly called many sided he was eminent in science and public service in diplomacy and in literature he was the edison of his day turning his scientific discoveries to the benefit of his fellow men he perceived the identity of lightning and electricity and set up the lightning rod he invented the franklin stove still widely used and refused to patent it he possessed a masterly shrewdness in business and practical affairs carlyle called him the father of all the yankees he founded a fire company assisted in founding a hospital and improved the cleaning and lighting of streets he developed journalism established the american philosophical society the public library in philadelphia and the university of pennsylvania he organized a postal system for the colonies which was the basis of the present united states post office bancroft the eminent historian called him the greatest diplomatist of his century he perfected the albany plan of union for the colonies he is the only statesman who signed the declaration of independence the treaty of alliance with france the treaty of peace with england and the constitution as a writer he has produced in his autobiography and in poor richard s almanac two works that are not surpassed by similar writing he received honorary degrees from harvard and yale from oxford and st andrews and was made a fellow of the royal society which awarded him the copley gold medal for improving natural knowledge he was one of the eight foreign associates of the french academy of science the careful study of the autobiography is also valuable because of the style in which it is written if robert louis stevenson is right in believing that his remarkable style was acquired by imitation then the youth who would gain the power to express his ideas clearly forcibly and interestingly cannot do better than to study franklin s method franklin s fame in the scientific world was due almost as much to his modest simple and sincere manner of presenting his discoveries and to the precision and clearness of the style in which he described his experiments as to the results he was able to announce sir humphry davy the celebrated english chemist himself an excellent literary critic as well as a great scientist said a singular felicity guided all franklin s researches and by very small means he established very grand truths the style and manner of his publication on electricity are almost as worthy of admiration as the doctrine it contains franklin s place in literature is hard to determine because he was not primarily a literary man his aim in his writings as in his life work was to be helpful to his fellow men for him writing was never an end in itself but always a means to an end yet his success as a scientist a statesman and a diplomat as well as socially was in no little part due to his ability as a writer his letters charmed all and made his correspondence eagerly sought his political arguments were the joy of his party and the dread of his opponents his scientific discoveries were explained in language at once so simple and so clear that plow boy and exquisite could follow his thought or his experiment to its conclusion the many sided franklin paul l ford as far as american literature is concerned franklin has no contemporaries before the autobiography only one literary work of importance had been produced in this country cotton mather s magnalia a church history of new england in a ponderous stiff style franklin was the first american author to gain a wide and permanent reputation in europe the autobiography poor richard father abraham s speech or the way to wealth as well as some of the bagatelles are as widely known abroad as any american writings franklin must also be classed as the first american humorist english literature of the eighteenth century was characterized by the development of prose periodical literature reached its perfection early in the century in the tatler and the spectator of addison and steele pamphleteers flourished throughout the period the homelier prose of bunyan and defoe gradually gave place to the more elegant and artificial language of samuel johnson who set the standard for prose writing from onward this century saw the beginnings of the modern novel in fielding s tom jones richardson s clarissa harlowe sterne s tristram shandy and goldsmith s vicar of wakefield gibbon wrote the decline and fall of the roman empire hume his history of england and adam smith the wealth of nations in the simplicity and vigor of his style franklin more nearly resembles the earlier group of writers in his first essays he was not an inferior imitator of addison in his numerous parables moral allegories and apologues he showed bunyan s influence but franklin was essentially a journalist in his swift terse style he is most like defoe who was the first great english journalist and master of the newspaper narrative the style of both writers is marked by homely vigorous expression satire burlesque repartee here the comparison must end defoe and his contemporaries were authors their vocation was writing and their success rests on the imaginative or creative power they displayed to authorship franklin laid no claim he wrote no work of the imagination he developed only incidentally a style in many respects as remarkable as that of his english contemporaries he wrote the best autobiography in existence one of the most widely known collections of maxims and an unsurpassed series of political and social satires because he was a man of unusual scope of power and usefulness who knew how to tell his fellow men the secrets of that power and that usefulness the story of the autobiography the account of how franklin s autobiography came to be written and of the adventures of the original manuscript forms in itself an interesting story the autobiography is franklin s longest work and yet it is only a fragment the first part written as a letter to his son william franklin was not intended for publication and the composition is more informal and the narrative more personal than in the second part from on which was written with a view to publication the entire manuscript shows little evidence of revision in fact the expression is so homely and natural that his grandson william temple franklin in editing the work changed some of the phrases because he thought them inelegant and vulgar franklin began the story of his life while on a visit to his friend bishop shipley at twyford in hampshire southern england in he took the manuscript completed to with him when he returned to philadelphia in it was left there with his other papers when he went to france in the following year and disappeared during the confusion incident to the revolution twenty three pages of closely written manuscript fell into the hands of abel james an old friend who sent a copy to franklin at passy near paris urging him to complete the story franklin took up the work at passy in and carried the narrative forward a few months he changed the plan to meet his new purpose of writing to benefit the young reader his work was soon interrupted and was not resumed until when he was at home in philadelphia he was now old infirm and suffering and was still engaged in public service under these discouraging conditions the work progressed slowly it finally stopped when the narrative reached the year copies of the manuscript were sent to friends of franklin in england and france among others to monsieur le veillard at paris the first edition of the autobiography was published in french at paris in it was clumsily and carelessly translated and was imperfect and unfinished where the translator got the manuscript is not known le veillard disclaimed any knowledge of the publication from this faulty french edition many others were printed some in germany two in england and another in france so great was the demand for the work in the meantime the original manuscript of the autobiography had started on a varied and adventurous career it was left by franklin with his other works to his grandson william temple franklin whom franklin designated as his literary executor when temple franklin came to publish his grandfather s works in he sent the original manuscript of the autobiography to the daughter of le veillard in exchange for her father s copy probably thinking the clearer transcript would make better printer s copy the original manuscript thus found its way to the le veillard family and connections where it remained until sold in to mr john bigelow united states minister to france by him it was later sold to mr e dwight church of new york and passed with the rest of mr church s library into the possession of mr henry e huntington the original manuscript of franklin s autobiography now rests in the vault in mr huntington s residence at fifth avenue and fifty seventh street new york city when mr bigelow came to examine his purchase he was astonished to find that what people had been reading for years as the authentic life of benjamin franklin by himself was only a garbled and incomplete version of the real autobiography temple franklin had taken unwarranted liberties with the original mr bigelow says he found more than twelve hundred changes in the text in therefore mr bigelow published the standard edition of franklin s autobiography it corrected errors in the previous editions and was the first english edition to contain the short fourth part comprising the last few pages of the manuscript written during the last year of franklin s life mr bigelow republished the autobiography with additional interesting matter in three volumes in in and in the text in this volume is that of mr bigelow s editions for the division into chapters and the chapter titles however the present editor is responsible the autobiography has been reprinted in the united states many scores of times and translated into all the languages of europe it has never lost its popularity and is still in constant demand at circulating libraries the reason for this popularity is not far to seek for in this work franklin told in a remarkable manner the story of a remarkable life he displayed hard common sense and a practical knowledge of the art of living he selected and arranged his material perhaps unconsciously with the unerring instinct of the journalist for the best effects his success is not a little due to his plain clear vigorous english he used short sentences and words homely expressions apt illustrations and pointed allusions franklin had a most interesting varied and unusual life he was one of the greatest conversationalists of his time his book is the record of that unusual life told in franklin s own unexcelled conversational style it is said that the best parts of boswell s famous biography of samuel johnson are those parts where boswell permits johnson to tell his own story in the autobiography a no less remarkable man and talker than samuel johnson is telling his own story throughout f w p the gilman country school baltimore september illustration pages and of the pennsylvania gazette the first number after franklin took control reduced nearly one half reproduced from a copy at the new york public library transcriber s note transcription of these pages are given at the end of the text autobiography of benjamin franklin i ancestry and early youth in boston twyford at the bishop of st asaph s dear son i have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes of my ancestors you may remember the inquiries i made among the remains of my relations when you were with me in england and the journey i undertook for that purpose imagining it may be equally agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life many of which you are yet unacquainted with and expecting the enjoyment of a week s uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement i sit down to write them for you to which i have besides some other inducements having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which i was born and bred to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the world and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of felicity the conducing means i made use of which with the blessing of god so well succeeded my posterity may like to know as they may find some of them suitable to their own situations and therefore fit to be imitated a small village not far from winchester in hampshire southern england here was the country seat of the bishop of st asaph dr jonathan shipley the good bishop as dr franklin used to style him their relations were intimate and confidential in his pulpit and in the house of lords as well as in society the bishop always opposed the harsh measures of the crown toward the colonies bigelow that felicity when i reflected on it has induced me sometimes to say that were it offered to my choice i should have no objection to a repetition of the same life from its beginning only asking the advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of the first so i might besides correcting the faults change some sinister accidents and events of it for others more favourable but though this were denied i should still accept the offer since such a repetition is not to be expected the next thing most like living one s life over again seems to be a recollection of that life and to make that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in writing hereby too i shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men to be talking of themselves and their own past actions and i shall indulge it without being tiresome to others who through respect to age might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing since this may be read or not as anyone pleases and lastly i may as well confess it since my denial of it will be believed by nobody perhaps i shall a good deal gratify my own vanity indeed i scarce ever heard or saw the introductory words without vanity i may say etc but some vain thing immediately followed most people dislike vanity in others whatever share they have of it themselves but i give it fair quarter wherever i meet with it being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor and to others that are within his sphere of action and therefore in many cases it would not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank god for his vanity among the other comforts of life in this connection woodrow wilson says and yet the surprising and delightful thing about this book the autobiography is that take it all in all it has not the low tone of conceit but is a staunch man s sober and unaffected assessment of himself and the circumstances of his career gibbon and hume the great british historians who were contemporaries of franklin express in their autobiographies the same feeling about the propriety of just self praise and now i speak of thanking god i desire with all humility to acknowledge that i owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to his kind providence which lead me to the means i used and gave them success my belief of this induces me to hope though i must not presume that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me in continuing that happiness or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse which i may experience as others have done the complexion of my future fortune being known to him only in whose power it is to bless to us even our afflictions the notes one of my uncles who had the same kind of curiosity in collecting family anecdotes once put into my hands furnished me with several particulars relating to our ancestors from these notes i learned that the family had lived in the same village ecton in northamptonshire for three hundred years and how much longer he knew not perhaps from the time when the name of franklin that before was the name of an order of people was assumed by them as a surname when others took surnames all over the kingdom on a freehold of about thirty acres aided by the smith s business which had continued in the family till his time the eldest son being always bred to that business a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons when i searched the registers at ecton i found an account of their births marriages and burials from the year only there being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding by that register i perceived that i was the youngest son of the youngest son for five generations back my grandfather thomas who was born in lived at ecton till he grew too old to follow business longer when he went to live with his son john a dyer at banbury in oxfordshire with whom my father served an apprenticeship there my grandfather died and lies buried we saw his gravestone in his eldest son thomas lived in the house at ecton and left it with the land to his only child a daughter who with her husband one fisher of wellingborough sold it to mr isted now lord of the manor there my grandfather had four sons that grew up viz thomas john benjamin and josiah i will give you what account i can of them at this distance from my papers and if these are not lost in my absence you will among them find many more particulars see introduction a small landowner thomas was bred a smith under his father but being ingenious and encouraged in learning as all my brothers were by an esquire palmer then the principal gentleman in that parish he qualified himself for the business of scrivener became a considerable man in the county was a chief mover of all public spirited undertakings for the county or town of northampton and his own village of which many instances were related of him and much taken notice of and patronized by the then lord halifax he died in january old style just four years to a day before i was born the account we received of his life and character from some old people at ecton i remember struck you as something extraordinary from its similarity to what you knew of mine had he died on the same day you said one might have supposed a transmigration january new style this change in the calendar was made in by pope gregory xiii and adopted in england in every year whose number in the common reckoning since christ is not divisible by as well as every year whose number is divisible by but not by shall have days and all other years shall have days in the eighteenth century there was a difference of eleven days between the old and the new style of reckoning which the english parliament canceled by making the rd of september the th the julian calendar or old style is still retained in russia and greece whose dates consequently are now days behind those of other christian countries john was bred a dyer i believe of woollens benjamin was bred a silk dyer serving an apprenticeship at london he was an ingenious man i remember him well for when i was a boy he came over to my father in boston and lived in the house with us some years he lived to a great age his grandson samuel franklin now lives in boston he left behind him two quarto volumes ms of his own poetry consisting of little occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations of which the following sent to me is a specimen he had formed a short hand of his own which he taught me but never practising it i have now forgot it i was named after this uncle there being a particular affection between him and my father he was very pious a great attender of sermons of the best preachers which he took down in his short hand and had with him many volumes of them he was also much of a politician too much perhaps for his station there fell lately into my hands in london a collection he had made of all the principal pamphlets relating to public affairs from to many of the volumes are wanting as appears by the numbering but there still remain eight volumes in folio and twenty four in quarto and in octavo a dealer in old books met with them and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him he brought them to me it seems my uncle must have left them here when he went to america which was about fifty years since there are many of his notes in the margins the specimen is not in the manuscript of the autobiography this obscure family of ours was early in the reformation and continued protestants through the reign of queen mary when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal against popery they had got an english bible and to conceal and secure it it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a joint stool when my great great grandfather read it to his family he turned up the joint stool upon his knees turning over the leaves then under the tapes one of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming who was an officer of the spiritual court in that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet when the bible remained concealed under it as before this anecdote i had from my uncle benjamin the family continued all of the church of england till about the end of charles the second s reign when some of the ministers that had been outed for non conformity holding conventicles in northamptonshire benjamin and josiah adhered to them and so continued all their lives the rest of the family remained with the episcopal church secret gatherings of dissenters from the established church illustration birthplace of franklin milk street boston josiah my father married young and carried his wife with three children into new england about the conventicles having been forbidden by law and frequently disturbed induced some considerable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither where they expected to enjoy their mode of religion with freedom by the same wife he had four children more born there and by a second wife ten more in all seventeen of which i remember thirteen sitting at one time at his table who all grew up to be men and women and married i was the youngest son and the youngest child but two and was born in boston new england my mother the second wife was abiah folger daughter of peter folger one of the first settlers of new england of whom honorable mention is made by cotton mather in his church history of that country entitled magnalia christi americana as a godly learned englishman if i remember the words rightly i have heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces but only one of them was printed which i saw now many years since it was written in in the home spun verse of that time and people and addressed to those then concerned in the government there it was in favour of liberty of conscience and in behalf of the baptists quakers and other sectaries that had been under persecution ascribing the indian wars and other distresses that had befallen the country to that persecution as so many judgments of god to punish so heinous an offense and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws the whole appeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness and manly freedom the six concluding lines i remember though i have forgotten the two first of the stanza but the purport of them was that his censures proceeded from good will and therefore he would be known to be the author because to be a libeller says he i hate it with my heart from sherburne town where now i dwell my name i do put here without offense your real friend it is peter folgier franklin was born on sunday january old style in a house on milk street opposite the old south meeting house where he was baptized on the day of his birth during a snowstorm the house where he was born was burned in griffin cotton mather clergyman author and scholar pastor of the north church boston he took an active part in the persecution of witchcraft nantucket my elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades i was put to the grammar school at eight years of age my father intending to devote me as the tithe of his sons to the service of the church my early readiness in learning to read which must have been very early as i do not remember when i could not read and the opinion of all his friends that i should certainly make a good scholar encouraged him in this purpose of his my uncle benjamin too approved of it and proposed to give me all his short hand volumes of sermons i suppose as a stock to set up with if i would learn his character i continued however at the grammar school not quite one year though in that time i had risen gradually from the middle of the class of that year to be the head of it and farther was removed into the next class above it in order to go with that into the third at the end of the year but my father in the meantime from a view of the expense of a college education which having so large a family he could not well afford and the mean living many so educated were afterwards able to obtain reasons that he gave to his friends in my hearing altered his first intention took me from the grammar school and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic kept by a then famous man mr george brownell very successful in his profession generally and that by mild encouraging methods under him i acquired fair writing pretty soon but i failed in the arithmetic and made no progress in it at ten years old i was taken home to assist my father in his business which was that of a tallow chandler and sope boiler a business he was not bred to but had assumed on his arrival in new england and on finding his dyeing trade would not maintain his family being in little request accordingly i was employed in cutting wick for the candles filling the dipping mould and the moulds for cast candles attending the shop going of errands etc tenth system of short hand i disliked the trade and had a strong inclination for the sea but my father declared against it however living near the water i was much in and about it learnt early to swim well and to manage boats and when in a boat or canoe with other boys i was commonly allowed to govern especially in any case of difficulty and upon other occasions i was generally a leader among the boys and sometimes led them into scrapes of which i will mention one instance as it shows an early projecting public spirit tho not then justly conducted there was a salt marsh that bounded part of the mill pond on the edge of which at high water we used to stand to fish for minnows by much trampling we had made it a mere quagmire my proposal was to build a wharf there fit for us to stand upon and i showed my comrades a large heap of stones which were intended for a new house near the marsh and which would very well suit our purpose accordingly in the evening when the workmen were gone i assembled a number of my playfellows and working with them diligently like so many emmets sometimes two or three to a stone we brought them all away and built our little wharf the next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones which were found in our wharf inquiry was made after the removers we were discovered and complained of several of us were corrected by our fathers and though i pleaded the usefulness of the work mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest i think you may like to know something of his person and character he had an excellent constitution of body was of middle stature but well set and very strong he was ingenious could draw prettily was skilled a little in music and had a clear pleasing voice so that when he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal as he sometimes did in an evening after the business of the day was over it was extremely agreeable to hear he had a mechanical genius too and on occasion was very handy in the use of other tradesmen s tools but his great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment in prudential matters both in private and publick affairs in the latter indeed he was never employed the numerous family he had to educate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to his trade but i remember well his being frequently visited by leading people who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of the church he belonged to and showed a good deal of respect for his judgment and advice he was also much consulted by private persons about their affairs when any difficulty occurred and frequently chosen an arbitrator between contending parties at his table he liked to have as often as he could some sensible friend or neighbor to converse with and always took care to start some ingenious or useful topic for discourse which might tend to improve the minds of his children by this means he turned our attention to what was good just and prudent in the conduct of life and little or no notice was ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table whether it was well or ill dressed in or out of season of good or bad flavor preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind so that i was bro t up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me and so unobservant of it that to this day if i am asked i can scarce tell a few hours after dinner what i dined upon this has been a convenience to me in traveling where my companions have been sometimes very unhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate because better instructed tastes and appetites my mother had likewise an excellent constitution she suckled all her ten children i never knew either my father or mother to have any sickness but that of which they dy d he at and she at years of age they lie buried together at boston where i some years since placed a marble over their grave with this inscription josiah franklin and abiah his wife lie here interred they lived lovingly together in wedlock fifty five years without an estate or any gainful employment by constant labor and industry with god s blessing they maintained a large family comfortably and brought up thirteen children and seven grandchildren reputably from this instance reader be encouraged to diligence in thy calling and distrust not providence he was a pious and prudent man she a discreet and virtuous woman their youngest son in filial regard to their memory places this stone j f born died etat a f born died this marble having decayed the citizens of boston in erected in its place a granite obelisk twenty one feet high bearing the original inscription quoted in the text and another explaining the erection of the monument by my rambling digressions i perceive myself to be grown old i us d to write more methodically but one does not dress for private company as for a publick ball tis perhaps only negligence to return i continued thus employed in my father s business for two years that is till i was twelve years old and my brother john who was bred to that business having left my father married and set up for himself at rhode island there was all appearance that i was destined to supply his place and become a tallow chandler but my dislike to the trade continuing my father was under apprehensions that if he did not find one for me more agreeable i should break away and get to sea as his son josiah had done to his great vexation he therefore sometimes took me to walk with him and see joiners bricklayers turners braziers etc at their work that he might observe my inclination and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other on land it has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen handle their tools and it has been useful to me having learnt so much by it as to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a workman could not readily be got and to construct little machines for my experiments while the intention of making the experiment was fresh and warm in my mind my father at last fixed upon the cutler s trade and my uncle benjamin s son samuel who was bred to that business in london being about that time established in boston i was sent to be with him some time on liking but his expectations of a fee with me displeasing my father i was taken home again ii beginning life as a printer from a child i was fond of reading and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books pleased with the pilgrim s progress my first collection was of john bunyan s works in separate little volumes i afterward sold them to enable me to buy r burton s historical collections they were small chapmen s books and cheap or in all my father s little library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity most of which i read and have since often regretted that at a time when i had such a thirst for knowledge more proper books had not fallen in my way since it was now resolved i should not be a clergyman plutarch s lives there was in which i read abundantly and i still think that time spent to great advantage there was also a book of defoe s called an essay on projects and another of dr mather s called essays to do good which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on some of the principal future events of my life small books sold by chapmen or peddlers this bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a printer though he had already one son james of that profession in my brother james returned from england with a press and letters to set up his business in boston i liked it much better than that of my father but still had a hankering for the sea to prevent the apprehended effect of such an inclination my father was impatient to have me bound to my brother i stood out some time but at last was persuaded and signed the indentures when i was yet but twelve years old i was to serve as an apprentice till i was twenty one years of age only i was to be allowed journeyman s wages during the last year in a little time i made great proficiency in the business and became a useful hand to my brother i now had access to better books an acquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes to borrow a small one which i was careful to return soon and clean often i sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night when the book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the morning lest it should be missed or wanted and after some time an ingenious tradesman mr matthew adams who had a pretty collection of books and who frequented our printing house took notice of me invited me to his library and very kindly lent me such books as i chose to read i now took a fancy to poetry and made some little pieces my brother thinking it might turn to account encouraged me and put me on composing occasional ballads one was called the lighthouse tragedy and contained an account of the drowning of captain worthilake with his two daughters the other was a sailor s song on the taking of teach or blackbeard the pirate they were wretched stuff in the grub street ballad style and when they were printed he sent me about the town to sell them the first sold wonderfully the event being recent having made a great noise this flattered my vanity but my father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances and telling me verse makers were generally beggars so i escaped being a poet most probably a very bad one but as prose writing has been of great use to me in the course of my life and was a principal means of my advancement i shall tell you how in such a situation i acquired what little ability i have in that way grub street famous in english literature as the home of poor writers there was another bookish lad in the town john collins by name with whom i was intimately acquainted we sometimes disputed and very fond we were of argument and very desirous of confuting one another which disputatious turn by the way is apt to become a very bad habit making people often extremely disagreeable in company by the contradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice and thence besides souring and spoiling the conversation is productive of disgusts and perhaps enmities where you may have occasion for friendship i had caught it by reading my father s books of dispute about religion persons of good sense i have since observed seldom fall into it except lawyers university men and men of all sorts that have been bred at edinborough a question was once somehow or other started between collins and me of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning and their abilities for study he was of opinion that it was improper and that they were naturally unequal to it i took the contrary side perhaps a little for dispute s sake he was naturally more eloquent had a ready plenty of words and sometimes as i thought bore me down more by his fluency than by the strength of his reasons as we parted without settling the point and were not to see one another again for some time i sat down to put my arguments in writing which i copied fair and sent to him he answered and i replied three or four letters of a side had passed when my father happened to find my papers and read them without entering into the discussion he took occasion to talk to me about the manner of my writing observed that though i had the advantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing which i ow d to the printing house i fell far short in elegance of expression in method and in perspicuity of which he convinced me by several instances i saw the justice of his remarks and thence grew more attentive to the manner in writing and determined to endeavor at improvement about this time i met with an odd volume of the spectator it was the third i had never before seen any of them i bought it read it over and over and was much delighted with it i thought the writing excellent and wished if possible to imitate it with this view i took some of the papers and making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence laid them by a few days and then without looking at the book try d to compleat the papers again by expressing each hinted sentiment at length and as fully as it had been expressed before in any suitable words that should come to hand then i compared my spectator with the original discovered some of my faults and corrected them but i found i wanted a stock of words or a readiness in recollecting and using them which i thought i should have acquired before that time if i had gone on making verses since the continual occasion for words of the same import but of different length to suit the measure or of different sound for the rhyme would have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for variety and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind and make me master of it therefore i took some of the tales and turned them into verse and after a time when i had pretty well forgotten the prose turned them back again i also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into confusion and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best order before i began to form the full sentences and compleat the paper this was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts by comparing my work afterwards with the original i discovered many faults and amended them but i sometimes had the pleasure of fancying that in certain particulars of small import i had been lucky enough to improve the method of the language and this encouraged me to think i might possibly in time come to be a tolerable english writer of which i was extremely ambitious my time for these exercises and for reading was at night after work or before it began in the morning or on sundays when i contrived to be in the printing house alone evading as much as i could the common attendance on public worship which my father used to exact of me when i was under his care and which indeed i still thought a duty thought i could not as it seemed to me afford time to practise it a daily london journal comprising satirical essays on social subjects published by addison and steele in the spectator and its predecessor the tatler marked the beginning of periodical literature when about years of age i happened to meet with a book written by one tryon recommending a vegetable diet i determined to go into it my brother being yet unmarried did not keep house but boarded himself and his apprentices in another family my refusing to eat flesh occasioned an inconveniency and i was frequently chid for my singularity i made myself acquainted with tryon s manner of preparing some of his dishes such as boiling potatoes or rice making hasty pudding and a few others and then proposed to my brother that if he would give me weekly half the money he paid for my board i would board myself he instantly agreed to it and i presently found that i could save half what he paid me this was an additional fund for buying books but i had another advantage in it my brother and the rest going from the printing house to their meals i remained there alone and dispatching presently my light repast which often was no more than a bisket or a slice of bread a handful of raisins or a tart from the pastry cook s and a glass of water had the rest of the time till their return for study in which i made the greater progress from that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which usually attend temperance in eating and drinking and now it was that being on some occasion made asham d of my ignorance in figures which i had twice failed in learning when at school i took cocker s book of arithmetick and went through the whole by myself with great ease i also read seller s and shermy s books of navigation and became acquainted with the little geometry they contain but never proceeded far in that science and i read about this time locke on human understanding and the art of thinking by messrs du port royal john locke a celebrated english philosopher founder of the so called common sense school of philosophers he drew up a constitution for the colonists of carolina a noted society of scholarly and devout men occupying the abbey of port royal near paris who published learned works among them the one here referred to better known as the port royal logic while i was intent on improving my language i met with an english grammar i think it was greenwood s at the end of which there were two little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic the latter finishing with a specimen of a dispute in the socratic method and soon after i procur d xenophon s memorable things of socrates wherein there are many instances of the same method i was charm d with it adopted it dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation and put on the humble inquirer and doubter and being then from reading shaftesbury and collins become a real doubter in many points of our religious doctrine i found this method safest for myself and very embarrassing to those against whom i used it therefore i took a delight in it practis d it continually and grew very artful and expert in drawing people even of superior knowledge into concessions the consequences of which they did not foresee entangling them in difficulties out of which they could not extricate themselves and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor my cause always deserved i continu d this method some few years but gradually left it retaining only the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest diffidence never using when i advanced anything that may possibly be disputed the words certainly undoubtedly or any others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion but rather say i conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so it appears to me or i should think it so or so for such and such reasons or i imagine it to be so or it is so if i am not mistaken this habit i believe has been of great advantage to me when i have had occasion to inculcate my opinions and persuade men into measures that i have been from time to time engaged in promoting and as the chief ends of conversation are to inform or to be informed to please or to persuade i wish well meaning sensible men would not lessen their power of doing good by a positive assuming manner that seldom fails to disgust tends to create opposition and to defeat everyone of those purposes for which speech was given to us to wit giving or receiving information or pleasure for if you would inform a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention if you wish information and improvement from the knowledge of others and yet at the same time express yourself as firmly fix d in your present opinions modest sensible men who do not love disputation will probably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error and by such a manner you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in pleasing your hearers or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire pope says judiciously men should be taught as if you taught them not and things unknown propos d as things forgot farther recommending to us to speak tho sure with seeming diffidence and he might have coupled with this line that which he has coupled with another i think less properly for want of modesty is want of sense if you ask why less properly i must repeat the lines immodest words admit of no defense for want of modesty is want of sense now is not want of sense where a man is so unfortunate as to want it some apology for his want of modesty and would not the lines stand more justly thus immodest words admit but this defense that want of modesty is want of sense this however i should submit to better judgments socrates confuted his opponents in argument by asking questions so skillfully devised that the answers would confirm the questioner s position or show the error of the opponent alexander pope the greatest english poet of the first half of the eighteenth century my brother had in or begun to print a newspaper it was the second that appeared in america and was called the new england courant the only one before it was the boston news letter i remember his being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking as not likely to succeed one newspaper being in their judgment enough for america at this time there are not less than five and twenty he went on however with the undertaking and after having worked in composing the types and printing off the sheets i was employed to carry the papers thro the streets to the customers franklin s memory does not serve him correctly here the courant was really the fifth newspaper established in america although generally called the fourth because the first public occurrences published in boston in was suppressed after the first issue following is the order in which the other four papers were published boston news letter boston gazette december the american weekly mercury philadelphia december the new england courant illustration first page of the new england courant of dec reduced about one third from a copy in the library of the massachusetts historical society transcriber s note transcription given at the end of the text he had some ingenious men among his friends who amus d themselves by writing little pieces for this paper which gain d it credit and made it more in demand and these gentlemen often visited us hearing their conversations and their accounts of the approbation their papers were received with i was excited to try my hand among them but being still a boy and suspecting that my brother would object to printing anything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine i contrived to disguise my hand and writing an anonymous paper i put it in at night under the door of the printing house it was found in the morning and communicated to his writing friends when they call d in as usual they read it commented on it in my hearing and i had the exquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation and that in their different guesses at the author none were named but men of some character among us for learning and ingenuity i suppose now that i was rather lucky in my judges and that perhaps they were not really so very good ones as i then esteem d them encourag d however by this i wrote and conveyed in the same way to the press several more papers which were equally approv d and i kept my secret till my small fund of sense for such performances was pretty well exhausted and then i discovered it when i began to be considered a little more by my brother s acquaintance and in a manner that did not quite please him as he thought probably with reason that it tended to make me too vain and perhaps this might be one occasion of the differences that we began to have about this time though a brother he considered himself as my master and me as his apprentice and accordingly expected the same services from me as he would from another while i thought he demean d me too much in some he requir d of me who from a brother expected more indulgence our disputes were often brought before our father and i fancy i was either generally in the right or else a better pleader because the judgment was generally in my favor but my brother was passionate and had often beaten me which i took extreamly amiss and thinking my apprenticeship very tedious i was continually wishing for some opportunity of shortening it which at length offered in a manner unexpected disclosed illustration i was employed to carry the papers thro the streets to the customers one of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point which i have now forgotten gave offense to the assembly he was taken up censur d and imprison d for a month by the speaker s warrant i suppose because he would not discover his author i too was taken up and examin d before the council but tho i did not give them any satisfaction they contented themselves with admonishing me and dismissed me considering me perhaps as an apprentice who was bound to keep his master s secrets during my brother s confinement which i resented a good deal notwithstanding our private differences i had the management of the paper and i made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it which my brother took very kindly while others began to consider me in an unfavorable light as a young genius that had a turn for libeling and satyr my brother s discharge was accompany d with an order of the house a very odd one that james franklin should no longer print the paper called the new england courant there was a consultation held in our printing house among his friends what he should do in this case some proposed to evade the order by changing the name of the paper but my brother seeing inconveniences in that it was finally concluded on as a better way to let it be printed for the future under the name of benjamin franklin and to avoid the censure of the assembly that might fall on him as still printing it by his apprentice the contrivance was that my old indenture should be return d to me with a full discharge on the back of it to be shown on occasion but to secure to him the benefit of my service i was to sign new indentures for the remainder of the term which were to be kept private a very flimsy scheme it was however it was immediately executed and the paper went on accordingly under my name for several months at length a fresh difference arising between my brother and me i took upon me to assert my freedom presuming that he would not venture to produce the new indentures it was not fair in me to take this advantage and this i therefore reckon one of the first errata of my life but the unfairness of it weighed little with me when under the impressions of resentment for the blows his passion too often urged him to bestow upon me though he was otherwise not an ill natur d man perhaps i was too saucy and provoking when he found i would leave him he took care to prevent my getting employment in any other printing house of the town by going round and speaking to every master who accordingly refus d to give me work i then thought of going to new york as the nearest place where there was a printer and i was rather inclin d to leave boston when i reflected that i had already made myself a little obnoxious to the governing party and from the arbitrary proceedings of the assembly in my brother s case it was likely i might if i stay d soon bring myself into scrapes and farther that my indiscreet disputations about religion began to make me pointed at with horror by good people as an infidel or atheist i determin d on the point but my father now siding with my brother i was sensible that if i attempted to go openly means would be used to prevent me my friend collins therefore undertook to manage a little for me he agreed with the captain of a new york sloop for my passage under the notion of my being a young acquaintance of his so i sold some of my books to raise a little money was taken on board privately and as we had a fair wind in three days i found myself in new york near miles from home a boy of but without the least recommendation to or knowledge of any person in the place and with very little money in my pocket illustration sailboat iii arrival in philadelphia my inclinations for the sea were by this time worne out or i might now have gratify d them but having a trade and supposing myself a pretty good workman i offer d my service to the printer in the place old mr william bradford who had been the first printer in pennsylvania but removed from thence upon the quarrel of george keith he could give me no employment having little to do and help enough already but says he my son at philadelphia has lately lost his principal hand aquilla rose by death if you go thither i believe he may employ you philadelphia was a hundred miles further i set out however in a boat for amboy leaving my chest and things to follow me round by sea in crossing the bay we met with a squall that tore our rotten sails to pieces prevented our getting into the kill and drove us upon long island in our way a drunken dutchman who was a passenger too fell overboard when he was sinking i reached through the water to his shock pate and drew him up so that we got him in again his ducking sobered him a little and he went to sleep taking first out of his pocket a book which he desir d i would dry for him it proved to be my old favorite author bunyan s pilgrim s progress in dutch finely printed on good paper with copper cuts a dress better than i had ever seen it wear in its own language i have since found that it has been translated into most of the languages of europe and suppose it has been more generally read than any other book except perhaps the bible honest john was the first that i know of who mix d narration and dialogue a method of writing very engaging to the reader who in the most interesting parts finds himself as it were brought into the company and present at the discourse de foe in his cruso his moll flanders religious courtship family instructor and other pieces has imitated it with success and richardson has done the same in his pamela etc kill van kull the channel separating staten island from new jersey on the north samuel richardson the father of the english novel wrote pamela clarissa harlowe and the history of sir charles grandison novels published in the form of letters when we drew near the island we found it was at a place where there could be no landing there being a great surff on the stony beach so we dropt anchor and swung round towards the shore some people came down to the water edge and hallow d to us as we did to them but the wind was so high and the surff so loud that we could not hear so as to understand each other there were canoes on the shore and we made signs and hallow d that they should fetch us but they either did not understand us or thought it impracticable so they went away and night coming on we had no remedy but to wait till the wind should abate and in the meantime the boatman and i concluded to sleep if we could and so crowded into the scuttle with the dutchman who was still wet and the spray beating over the head of our boat leak d thro to us so that we were soon almost as wet as he in this manner we lay all night with very little rest but the wind abating the next day we made a shift to reach amboy before night having been thirty hours on the water without victuals or any drink but a bottle of filthy rum and the water we sail d on being salt in the evening i found myself very feverish and went in to bed but having read somewhere that cold water drank plentifully was good for a fever i follow d the prescription sweat plentifully most of the night my fever left me and in the morning crossing the ferry i proceeded on my journey on foot having fifty miles to burlington where i was told i should find boats that would carry me the rest of the way to philadelphia illustration it rained very hard all the day it rained very hard all the day i was thoroughly soak d and by noon a good deal tired so i stopt at a poor inn where i staid all night beginning now to wish that i had never left home i cut so miserable a figure too that i found by the questions ask d me i was suspected to be some runaway servant and in danger of being taken up on that suspicion however i proceeded the next day and got in the evening to an inn within eight or ten miles of burlington kept by one dr brown he entered into conversation with me while i took some refreshment and finding i had read a little became very sociable and friendly our acquaintance continu d as long as he liv d he had been i imagine an itinerant doctor for there was no town in england or country in europe of which he could not give a very particular account he had some letters and was ingenious but much of an unbeliever and wickedly undertook some years after to travesty the bible in doggrel verse as cotton had done virgil by this means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light and might have hurt weak minds if his work had been published but it never was at his house i lay that night and the next morning reach d burlington but had the mortification to find that the regular boats were gone a little before my coming and no other expected to go before tuesday this being saturday wherefore i returned to an old woman in the town of whom i had bought gingerbread to eat on the water and ask d her advice she invited me to lodge at her house till a passage by water should offer and being tired with my foot traveling i accepted the invitation she understanding i was a printer would have had me stay at that town and follow my business being ignorant of the stock necessary to begin with she was very hospitable gave me a dinner of ox cheek with great good will accepting only of a pot of ale in return and i thought myself fixed till tuesday should come however walking in the evening by the side of the river a boat came by which i found was going towards philadelphia with several people in her they took me in and as there was no wind we row d all the way and about midnight not having yet seen the city some of the company were confident we must have passed it and would row no farther the others knew not where we were so we put toward the shore got into a creek landed near an old fence with the rails of which we made a fire the night being cold in october and there we remained till daylight then one of the company knew the place to be cooper s creek a little above philadelphia which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek and arriv d there about eight or nine o clock on the sunday morning and landed at the market street wharf i have been the more particular in this description of my journey and shall be so of my first entry into that city that you may in your mind compare such unlikely beginnings with the figure i have since made there i was in my working dress my best clothes being to come round by sea i was dirty from my journey my pockets were stuff d out with shirts and stockings and i knew no soul nor where to look for lodging i was fatigued with traveling rowing and want of rest i was very hungry and my whole stock of cash consisted of a dutch dollar and about a shilling in copper the latter i gave the people of the boat for my passage who at first refus d it on account of my rowing but i insisted on their taking it a man being sometimes more generous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty perhaps thro fear of being thought to have but little then i walked up the street gazing about till near the market house i met a boy with bread i had made many a meal on bread and inquiring where he got it i went immediately to the baker s he directed me to in second street and ask d for bisket intending such as we had in boston but they it seems were not made in philadelphia then i asked for a three penny loaf and was told they had none such so not considering or knowing the difference of money and the greater cheapness nor the names of his bread i bade him give me three penny worth of any sort he gave me accordingly three great puffy rolls i was surpris d at the quantity but took it and having no room in my pockets walk d off with a roll under each arm and eating the other thus i went up market street as far as fourth street passing by the door of mr read my future wife s father when she standing at the door saw me and thought i made as i certainly did a most awkward ridiculous appearance then i turned and went down chestnut street and part of walnut street eating my roll all the way and coming round found myself again at market street wharf near the boat i came in to which i went for a draught of the river water and being filled with one of my rolls gave the other two to a woman and her child that came down the river in the boat with us and were waiting to go farther illustration she standing at the door saw me and thought i made as i certainly did a most awkward ridiculous appearance thus refreshed i walked again up the street which by this time had many clean dressed people in it who were all walking the same way i joined them and thereby was led into the great meeting house of the quakers near the market i sat down among them and after looking round awhile and hearing nothing said being very drowsy thro labour and want of rest the preceding night i fell fast asleep and continu d so till the meeting broke up when one was kind enough to rouse me this was therefore the first house i was in or slept in in philadelphia walking down again toward the river and looking in the faces of people i met a young quaker man whose countenance i lik d and accosting him requested he would tell me where a stranger could get lodging we were then near the sign of the three mariners here says he is one place that entertains strangers but it is not a reputable house if thee wilt walk with me i ll show thee a better he brought me to the crooked billet in water street here i got a dinner and while i was eating it several sly questions were asked me as it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance that i might be some runaway after dinner my sleepiness return d and being shown to a bed i lay down without undressing and slept till six in the evening was call d to supper went to bed again very early and slept soundly till next morning then i made myself as tidy as i could and went to andrew bradford the printer s i found in the shop the old man his father whom i had seen at new york and who traveling on horseback had got to philadelphia before me he introduc d me to his son who receiv d me civilly gave me a breakfast but told me he did not at present want a hand being lately suppli d with one but there was another printer in town lately set up one keimer who perhaps might employ me if not i should be welcome to lodge at his house and he would give me a little work to do now and then till fuller business should offer the old gentleman said he would go with me to the new printer and when we found him neighbour says bradford i have brought to see you a young man of your business perhaps you may want such a one he ask d me a few questions put a composing stick in my hand to see how i work d and then said he would employ me soon though he had just then nothing for me to do and taking old bradford whom he had never seen before to be one of the town s people that had a good will for him enter d into a conversation on his present undertaking and prospects while bradford not discovering that he was the other printer s father on keimer s saying he expected soon to get the greatest part of the business into his own hands drew him on by artful questions and starting little doubts to explain all his views what interest he reli d on and in what manner he intended to proceed i who stood by and heard all saw immediately that one of them was a crafty old sophister and the other a mere novice bradford left me with keimer who was greatly surpris d when i told him who the old man was keimer s printing house i found consisted of an old shatter d press and one small worn out font of english which he was then using himself composing an elegy on aquilla rose before mentioned an ingenious young man of excellent character much respected in the town clerk of the assembly and a pretty poet keimer made verses too but very indifferently he could not be said to write them for his manner was to compose them in the types directly out of his head so there being no copy but one pair of cases and the elegy likely to require all the letter no one could help him i endeavour d to put his press which he had not yet us d and of which he understood nothing into order fit to be work d with and promising to come and print off his elegy as soon as he should have got it ready i return d to bradford s who gave me a little job to do for the present and there i lodged and dieted a few days after keimer sent for me to print off the elegy and now he had got another pair of cases and a pamphlet to reprint on which he set me to work these two printers i found poorly qualified for their business bradford had not been bred to it and was very illiterate and keimer tho something of a scholar was a mere compositor knowing nothing of presswork he had been one of the french prophets and could act their enthusiastic agitations at this time he did not profess any particular religion but something of all on occasion was very ignorant of the world and had as i afterward found a good deal of the knave in his composition he did not like my lodging at bradford s while i work d with him he had a house indeed but without furniture so he could not lodge me but he got me a lodging at mr read s before mentioned who was the owner of his house and my chest and clothes being come by this time i made rather a more respectable appearance in the eyes of miss read than i had done when she first happen d to see me eating my roll in the street manuscript the frames for holding type are in two sections the upper for capitals and the lower for small letters protestants of the south of france who became fanatical under the persecutions of louis xiv and thought they had the gift of prophecy they had as mottoes no taxes and liberty of conscience i began now to have some acquaintance among the young people of the town that were lovers of reading with whom i spent my evenings very pleasantly and gaining money by my industry and frugality i lived very agreeably forgetting boston as much as i could and not desiring that any there should know where i resided except my friend collins who was in my secret and kept it when i wrote to him at length an incident happened that sent me back again much sooner than i had intended i had a brother in law robert holmes master of a sloop that traded between boston and delaware he being at newcastle forty miles below philadelphia heard there of me and wrote me a letter mentioning the concern of my friends in boston at my abrupt departure assuring me of their good will to me and that everything would be accommodated to my mind if i would return to which he exhorted me very earnestly i wrote an answer to his letter thank d him for his advice but stated my reasons for quitting boston fully and in such a light as to convince him i was not so wrong as he had apprehended iv first visit to boston sir william keith governor of the province was then at newcastle and captain holmes happening to be in company with him when my letter came to hand spoke to him of me and show d him the letter the governor read it and seem d surpris d when he was told my age he said i appear d a young man of promising parts and therefore should be encouraged the printers at philadelphia were wretched ones and if i would set up there he made no doubt i should succeed for his part he would procure me the public business and do me every other service in his power this my brother in law afterwards told me in boston but i knew as yet nothing of it when one day keimer and i being at work together near the window we saw the governor and another gentleman which proved to be colonel french of newcastle finely dress d come directly across the street to our house and heard them at the door keimer ran down immediately thinking it a visit to him but the governor inquir d for me came up and with a condescension and politeness i had been quite unus d to made me many compliments desired to be acquainted with me blam d me kindly for not having made myself known to him when i first came to the place and would have me away with him to the tavern where he was going with colonel french to taste as he said some excellent madeira i was not a little surprised and keimer star d like a pig poison d i went however with the governor and colonel french to a tavern at the corner of third street and over the madeira he propos d my setting up my business laid before me the probabilities of success and both he and colonel french assur d me i should have their interest and influence in procuring the public business of both governments on my doubting whether my father would assist me in it sir william said he would give me a letter to him in which he would state the advantages and he did not doubt of prevailing with him so it was concluded i should return to boston in the first vessel with the governor s letter recommending me to my father in the meantime the intention was to be kept a secret and i went on working with keimer as usual the governor sending for me now and then to dine with him a very great honour i thought it and conversing with me in the most affable familiar and friendly manner imaginable temple franklin considered this specific figure vulgar and changed it to stared with astonishment pennsylvania and delaware about the end of april a little vessel offer d for boston i took leave of keimer as going to see my friends the governor gave me an ample letter saying many flattering things of me to my father and strongly recommending the project of my setting up at philadelphia as a thing that must make my fortune we struck on a shoal in going down the bay and sprung a leak we had a blustering time at sea and were oblig d to pump almost continually at which i took my turn we arriv d safe however at boston in about a fortnight i had been absent seven months and my friends had heard nothing of me for my br holmes was not yet return d and had not written about me my unexpected appearance surpris d the family all were however very glad to see me and made me welcome except my brother i went to see him at his printing house i was better dress d than ever while in his service having a genteel new suit from head to foot a watch and my pockets lin d with near five pounds sterling in silver he receiv d me not very frankly look d me all over and turn d to his work again illustration the journeymen were inquisitive the journeymen were inquisitive where i had been what sort of a country it was and how i lik d it i prais d it much and the happy life i led in it expressing strongly my intention of returning to it and one of them asking what kind of money we had there i produc d a handful of silver and spread it before them which was a kind of raree show they had not been us d to paper being the money of boston then i took an opportunity of letting them see my watch and lastly my brother still grum and sullen i gave them a piece of eight to drink and took my leave this visit of mine offended him extreamly for when my mother some time after spoke to him of a reconciliation and of her wishes to see us on good terms together and that we might live for the future as brothers he said i had insulted him in such a manner before his people that he could never forget or forgive it in this however he was mistaken a peep show in a box there were no mints in the colonies so the metal money was of foreign coinage and not nearly so common as paper money which was printed in large quantities in america even in small denominations spanish dollar about equivalent to our dollar my father received the governor s letter with some apparent surprise but said little of it to me for some days when capt holmes returning he show d it to him asked him if he knew keith and what kind of man he was adding his opinion that he must be of small discretion to think of setting a boy up in business who wanted yet three years of being at man s estate holmes said what he could in favour of the project but my father was clear in the impropriety of it and at last gave a flat denial to it then he wrote a civil letter to sir william thanking him for the patronage he had so kindly offered me but declining to assist me as yet in setting up i being in his opinion too young to be trusted with the management of a business so important and for which the preparation must be so expensive my friend and companion collins who was a clerk in the post office pleas d with the account i gave him of my new country determined to go thither also and while i waited for my father s determination he set out before me by land to rhode island leaving his books which were a pretty collection of mathematicks and natural philosophy to come with mine and me to new york where he propos d to wait for me my father tho he did not approve sir william s proposition was yet pleas d that i had been able to obtain so advantageous a character from a person of such note where i had resided and that i had been so industrious and careful as to equip myself so handsomely in so short a time therefore seeing no prospect of an accommodation between my brother and me he gave his consent to my returning again to philadelphia advis d me to behave respectfully to the people there endeavour to obtain the general esteem and avoid lampooning and libeling to which he thought i had too much inclination telling me that by steady industry and a prudent parsimony i might save enough by the time i was one and twenty to set me up and that if i came near the matter he would help me out with the rest this was all i could obtain except some small gifts as tokens of his and my mother s love when i embark d again for new york now with their approbation and their blessing the sloop putting in at newport rhode island i visited my brother john who had been married and settled there some years he received me very affectionately for he always lov d me a friend of his one vernon having some money due to him in pennsylvania about thirty five pounds currency desired i would receive it for him and keep it till i had his directions what to remit it in accordingly he gave me an order this afterwards occasion d me a good deal of uneasiness at newport we took in a number of passengers for new york among which were two young women companions and a grave sensible matronlike quaker woman with her attendants i had shown an obliging readiness to do her some little services which impress d her i suppose with a degree of good will toward me therefore when she saw a daily growing familiarity between me and the two young women which they appear d to encourage she took me aside and said young man i am concern d for thee as thou hast no friend with thee and seems not to know much of the world or of the snares youth is expos d to depend upon it those are very bad women i can see it in all their actions and if thee art not upon thy guard they will draw thee into some danger they are strangers to thee and i advise thee in a friendly concern for thy welfare to have no acquaintance with them as i seem d at first not to think so ill of them as she did she mentioned some things she had observ d and heard that had escap d my notice but now convinc d me she was right i thank d her for her kind advice and promis d to follow it when we arriv d at new york they told me where they liv d and invited me to come and see them but i avoided it and it was well i did for the next day the captain miss d a silver spoon and some other things that had been taken out of his cabin and knowing that these were a couple of strumpets he got a warrant to search their lodgings found the stolen goods and had the thieves punish d so tho we had escap d a sunken rock which we scrap d upon in the passage i thought this escape of rather more importance to me at new york i found my friend collins who had arriv d there some time before me we had been intimate from children and had read the same books together but he had the advantage of more time for reading and studying and a wonderful genius for mathematical learning in which he far outstript me while i liv d in boston most of my hours of leisure for conversation were spent with him and he continu d a sober as well as an industrious lad was much respected for his learning by several of the clergy and other gentlemen and seemed to promise making a good figure in life but during my absence he had acquir d a habit of sotting with brandy and i found by his own account and what i heard from others that he had been drunk every day since his arrival at new york and behav d very oddly he had gam d too and lost his money so that i was oblig d to discharge his lodgings and defray his expenses to and at philadelphia which prov d extremely inconvenient to me the then governor of new york burnet son of bishop burnet hearing from the captain that a young man one of his passengers had a great many books desir d he would bring me to see him i waited upon him accordingly and should have taken collins with me but that he was not sober the gov r treated me with great civility show d me his library which was a very large one and we had a good deal of conversation about books and authors this was the second governor who had done me the honour to take notice of me which to a poor boy like me was very pleasing we proceeded to philadelphia i received on the way vernon s money without which we could hardly have finish d our journey collins wished to be employ d in some counting house but whether they discover d his dramming by his breath or by his behaviour tho he had some recommendations he met with no success in any application and continu d lodging and boarding at the same house with me and at my expense knowing i had that money of vernon s he was continually borrowing of me still promising repayment as soon as he should be in business at length he had got so much of it that i was distress d to think what i should do in case of being call d on to remit it his drinking continu d about which we sometimes quarrel d for when a little intoxicated he was very fractious once in a boat on the delaware with some other young men he refused to row in his turn i will be row d home says he we will not row you says i you must or stay all night on the water says he just as you please the others said let us row what signifies it but my mind being soured with his other conduct i continu d to refuse so he swore he would make me row or throw me overboard and coming along stepping on the thwarts toward me when he came up and struck at me i clapped my hand under his crutch and rising pitched him head foremost into the river i knew he was a good swimmer and so was under little concern about him but before he could get round to lay hold of the boat we had with a few strokes pull d her out of his reach and ever when he drew near the boat we ask d if he would row striking a few strokes to slide her away from him he was ready to die with vexation and obstinately would not promise to row however seeing him at last beginning to tire we lifted him in and brought him home dripping wet in the evening we hardly exchang d a civil word afterwards and a west india captain who had a commission to procure a tutor for the sons of a gentleman at barbados happening to meet with him agreed to carry him thither he left me then promising to remit me the first money he should receive in order to discharge the debt but i never heard of him after the breaking into this money of vernon s was one of the first great errata of my life and this affair show d that my father was not much out in his judgment when he suppos d me too young to manage business of importance but sir william on reading his letter said he was too prudent there was great difference in persons and discretion did not always accompany years nor was youth always without it and since he will not set you up says he i will do it myself give me an inventory of the things necessary to be had from england and i will send for them you shall repay me when you are able i am resolv d to have a good printer here and i am sure you must succeed this was spoken with such an appearance of cordiality that i had not the least doubt of his meaning what he said i had hitherto kept the proposition of my setting up a secret in philadelphia and i still kept it had it been known that i depended on the governor probably some friend that knew him better would have advis d me not to rely on him as i afterwards heard it as his known character to be liberal of promises which he never meant to keep yet unsolicited as he was by me how could i think his generous offers insincere i believ d him one of the best men in the world i presented him an inventory of a little print house amounting by my computation to about one hundred pounds sterling he lik d it but ask d me if my being on the spot in england to chuse the types and see that everything was good of the kind might not be of some advantage then says he when there you may make acquaintances and establish correspondences in the bookselling and stationery way i agreed that this might be advantageous then says he get yourself ready to go with annis which was the annual ship and the only one at that time usually passing between london and philadelphia but it would be some months before annis sail d so i continued working with keimer fretting about the money collins had got from me and in daily apprehensions of being call d upon by vernon which however did not happen for some years after i believe i have omitted mentioning that in my first voyage from boston being becalm d off block island our people set about catching cod and hauled up a great many hitherto i had stuck to my resolution of not eating animal food and on this occasion i consider d with my master tryon the taking every fish as a kind of unprovoked murder since none of them had or ever could do us any injury that might justify the slaughter all this seemed very reasonable but i had formerly been a great lover of fish and when this came hot out of the frying pan it smelt admirably well i balanc d some time between principle and inclination till i recollected that when the fish were opened i saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs then thought i if you eat one another i don t see why we mayn t eat you so i din d upon cod very heartily and continued to eat with other people returning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet so convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable creature since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do v early friends in philadelphia keimer and i liv d on a pretty good familiar footing and agreed tolerably well for he suspected nothing of my setting up he retained a great deal of his old enthusiasms and lov d argumentation we therefore had many disputations i used to work him so with my socratic method and had trepann d him so often by questions apparently so distant from any point we had in hand and yet by degrees led to the point and brought him into difficulties and contradictions that at last he grew ridiculously cautious and would hardly answer me the most common question without asking first what do you intend to infer from that however it gave him so high an opinion of my abilities in the confuting way that he seriously proposed my being his colleague in a project he had of setting up a new sect he was to preach the doctrines and i was to confound all opponents when he came to explain with me upon the doctrines i found several conundrums which i objected to unless i might have my way a little too and introduce some of mine keimer wore his beard at full length because somewhere in the mosaic law it is said thou shalt not mar the corners of thy beard he likewise kept the seventh day sabbath and these two points were essentials with him i dislik d both but agreed to admit them upon condition of his adopting the doctrine of using no animal food i doubt said he my constitution will not bear that i assur d him it would and that he would be the better for it he was usually a great glutton and i promised myself some diversion in half starving him he agreed to try the practice if i would keep him company i did so and we held it for three months we had our victuals dress d and brought to us regularly by a woman in the neighborhood who had from me a list of forty dishes to be prepar d for us at different times in all which there was neither fish flesh nor fowl and the whim suited me the better at this time from the cheapness of it not costing us above eighteenpence sterling each per week i have since kept several lents most strictly leaving the common diet for that and that for the common abruptly without the least inconvenience so that i think there is little in the advice of making those changes by easy gradations i went on pleasantly but poor keimer suffered grievously tired of the project long d for the flesh pots of egypt and order d a roast pig he invited me and two women friends to dine with him but it being brought too soon upon table he could not resist the temptation and ate the whole before we came i had made some courtship during this time to miss read i had a great respect and affection for her and had some reason to believe she had the same for me but as i was about to take a long voyage and we were both very young only a little above eighteen it was thought most prudent by her mother to prevent our going too far at present as a marriage if it was to take place would be more convenient after my return when i should be as i expected set up in my business perhaps too she thought my expectations not so well founded as i imagined them to be my chief acquaintances at this time were charles osborne joseph watson and james ralph all lovers of reading the two first were clerks to an eminent scrivener or conveyancer in the town charles brockden the other was clerk to a merchant watson was a pious sensible young man of great integrity the others rather more lax in their principles of religion particularly ralph who as well as collins had been unsettled by me for which they both made me suffer osborne was sensible candid frank sincere and affectionate to his friends but in literary matters too fond of criticizing ralph was ingenious genteel in his manners and extremely eloquent i think i never knew a prettier talker both of them were great admirers of poetry and began to try their hands in little pieces many pleasant walks we four had together on sundays into the woods near schuylkill where we read to one another and conferr d on what we read illustration many pleasant walks we four had together ralph was inclin d to pursue the study of poetry not doubting but he might become eminent in it and make his fortune by it alleging that the best poets must when they first began to write make as many faults as he did osborne dissuaded him assur d him he had no genius for poetry and advis d him to think of nothing beyond the business he was bred to that in the mercantile way tho he had no stock he might by his diligence and punctuality recommend himself to employment as a factor and in time acquire wherewith to trade on his own account i approv d the amusing one s self with poetry now and then so far as to improve one s language but no farther on this it was propos d that we should each of us at our next meeting produce a piece of our own composing in order to improve by our mutual observations criticisms and corrections as language and expression were what we had in view we excluded all considerations of invention by agreeing that the task should be a version of the eighteenth psalm which describes the descent of a deity when the time of our meeting drew nigh ralph called on me first and let me know his piece was ready i told him i had been busy and having little inclination had done nothing he then show d me his piece for my opinion and i much approv d it as it appear d to me to have great merit now says he osborne never will allow the least merit in anything of mine but makes criticisms out of mere envy he is not so jealous of you i wish therefore you would take this piece and produce it as yours i will pretend not to have had time and so produce nothing we shall then see what he will say to it it was agreed and i immediately transcrib d it that it might appear in my own hand we met watson s performance was read there were some beauties in it but many defects osborne s was read it was much better ralph did it justice remarked some faults but applauded the beauties he himself had nothing to produce i was backward seemed desirous of being excused had not had sufficient time to correct etc but no excuse could be admitted produce i must it was read and repeated watson and osborne gave up the contest and join d in applauding it ralph only made some criticisms and propos d some amendments but i defended my text osborne was against ralph and told him he was no better a critic than poet so he dropt the argument as they two went home together osborne expressed himself still more strongly in favor of what he thought my production having restrain d himself before as he said lest i should think it flattery but who would have imagin d said he that franklin had been capable of such a performance such painting such force such fire he has even improv d the original in his common conversation he seems to have no choice of words he hesitates and blunders and yet good god how he writes when we next met ralph discovered the trick we had plaid him and osborne was a little laughed at this transaction fixed ralph in his resolution of becoming a poet i did all i could to dissuade him from it but he continued scribbling verses till pope cured him he became however a pretty good prose writer more of him hereafter but as i may not have occasion again to mention the other two i shall just remark here that watson died in my arms a few years after much lamented being the best of our set osborne went to the west indies where he became an eminent lawyer and made money but died young he and i had made a serious agreement that the one who happen d first to die should if possible make a friendly visit to the other and acquaint him how he found things in that separate state but he never fulfill d his promise in one of the later editions of the dunciad occur the following lines silence ye wolves while ralph to cynthia howls and makes night hideous answer him ye owls to this the poet adds the following note james ralph a name inserted after the first editions not known till he writ a swearing piece called sawney very abusive of dr swift mr gay and myself vi first visit to london the governor seeming to like my company had me frequently to his house and his setting me up was always mention d as a fixed thing i was to take with me letters recommendatory to a number of his friends besides the letter of credit to furnish me with the necessary money for purchasing the press and types paper etc for these letters i was appointed to call at different times when they were to be ready but a future time was still named thus he went on till the ship whose departure too had been several times postponed was on the point of sailing then when i call d to take my leave and receive the letters his secretary dr bard came out to me and said the governor was extremely busy in writing but would be down at newcastle before the ship and there the letters would be delivered to me ralph though married and having one child had determined to accompany me in this voyage it was thought he intended to establish a correspondence and obtain goods to sell on commission but i found afterwards that thro some discontent with his wife s relations he purposed to leave her on their hands and never return again having taken leave of my friends and interchang d some promises with miss read i left philadelphia in the ship which anchor d at newcastle the governor was there but when i went to his lodging the secretary came to me from him with the civillest message in the world that he could not then see me being engaged in business of the utmost importance but should send the letters to me on board wished me heartily a good voyage and a speedy return etc i returned on board a little puzzled but still not doubting mr andrew hamilton a famous lawyer of philadelphia had taken passage in the same ship for himself and son and with mr denham a quaker merchant and messrs onion and russel masters of an iron work in maryland had engaged the great cabin so that ralph and i were forced to take up with a berth in the steerage and none on board knowing us were considered as ordinary persons but mr hamilton and his son it was james since governor return d from newcastle to philadelphia the father being recall d by a great fee to plead for a seized ship and just before we sail d colonel french coming on board and showing me great respect i was more taken notice of and with my friend ralph invited by the other gentlemen to come into the cabin there being now room accordingly we remov d thither understanding that colonel french had brought on board the governor s despatches i ask d the captain for those letters that were to be under my care he said all were put into the bag together and he could not then come at them but before we landed in england i should have an opportunity of picking them out so i was satisfied for the present and we proceeded on our voyage we had a sociable company in the cabin and lived uncommonly well having the addition of all mr hamilton s stores who had laid in plentifully in this passage mr denham contracted a friendship for me that continued during his life the voyage was otherwise not a pleasant one as we had a great deal of bad weather when we came into the channel the captain kept his word with me and gave me an opportunity of examining the bag for the governor s letters i found none upon which my name was put as under my care i picked out six or seven that by the handwriting i thought might be the promised letters especially as one of them was directed to basket the king s printer and another to some stationer we arriv d in london the th of december i waited upon the stationer who came first in my way delivering the letter as from governor keith i don t know such a person says he but opening the letter o this is from riddlesden i have lately found him to be a compleat rascal and i will have nothing to do with him nor receive any letters from him so putting the letter into my hand he turn d on his heel and left me to serve some customer i was surprized to find these were not the governor s letters and after recollecting and comparing circumstances i began to doubt his sincerity i found my friend denham and opened the whole affair to him he let me into keith s character told me there was not the least probability that he had written any letters for me that no one who knew him had the smallest dependence on him and he laught at the notion of the governor s giving me a letter of credit having as he said no credit to give on my expressing some concern about what i should do he advised me to endeavour getting some employment in the way of my business among the printers here said he you will improve yourself and when you return to america you will set up to greater advantage illustration so putting the letter into my hand we both of us happen d to know as well as the stationer that riddlesden the attorney was a very knave he had half ruin d miss read s father by persuading him to be bound for him by this letter it appear d there was a secret scheme on foot to the prejudice of hamilton suppos d to be then coming over with us and that keith was concerned in it with riddlesden denham who was a friend of hamilton s thought he ought to be acquainted with it so when he arriv d in england which was soon after partly from resentment and ill will to keith and riddlesden and partly from good will to him i waited on him and gave him the letter he thank d me cordially the information being of importance to him and from that time he became my friend greatly to my advantage afterwards on many occasions but what shall we think of a governor s playing such pitiful tricks and imposing so grossly on a poor ignorant boy it was a habit he had acquired he wish d to please everybody and having little to give he gave expectations he was otherwise an ingenious sensible man a pretty good writer and a good governor for the people tho not for his constituents the proprietaries whose instructions he sometimes disregarded several of our best laws were of his planning and passed during his administration ralph and i were inseparable companions we took lodgings together in little britain at three shillings and sixpence a week as much as we could then afford he found some relations but they were poor and unable to assist him he now let me know his intentions of remaining in london and that he never meant to return to philadelphia he had brought no money with him the whole he could muster having been expended in paying his passage i had fifteen pistoles so he borrowed occasionally of me to subsist while he was looking out for business he first endeavoured to get into the play house believing himself qualify d for an actor but wilkes to whom he apply d advis d him candidly not to think of that employment as it was impossible he should succeed in it then he propos d to roberts a publisher in paternoster row to write for him a weekly paper like the spectator on certain conditions which roberts did not approve then he endeavoured to get employment as a hackney writer to copy for the stationers and lawyers about the temple but could find no vacancy one of the oldest parts of london north of st paul s cathedral called little britain because the dukes of brittany used to live there see the essay entitled little britain in washington irving s sketch book a gold coin worth about four dollars in our money a popular comedian manager of drury lane theater street north of st paul s occupied by publishing houses law schools and lawyers residences situated southwest of st paul s between fleet street and the thames i immediately got into work at palmer s then a famous printing house in bartholomew close and here i continu d near a year i was pretty diligent but spent with ralph a good deal of my earnings in going to plays and other places of amusement we had together consumed all my pistoles and now just rubbed on from hand to mouth he seem d quite to forget his wife and child and i by degrees my engagements with miss read to whom i never wrote more than one letter and that was to let her know i was not likely soon to return this was another of the great errata of my life which i should wish to correct if i were to live it over again in fact by our expenses i was constantly kept unable to pay my passage at palmer s i was employed in composing for the second edition of wollaston s religion of nature some of his reasonings not appearing to me well founded i wrote a little metaphysical piece in which i made remarks on them it was entitled a dissertation on liberty and necessity pleasure and pain i inscribed it to my friend ralph i printed a small number it occasion d my being more consider d by mr palmer as a young man of some ingenuity tho he seriously expostulated with me upon the principles of my pamphlet which to him appear d abominable my printing this pamphlet was another erratum while i lodg d in little britain i made an acquaintance with one wilcox a bookseller whose shop was at the next door he had an immense collection of second hand books circulating libraries were not then in use but we agreed that on certain reasonable terms which i have now forgotten i might take read and return any of his books this i esteem d a great advantage and i made as much use of it as i could my pamphlet by some means falling into the hands of one lyons a surgeon author of a book entitled the infallibility of human judgment it occasioned an acquaintance between us he took great notice of me called on me often to converse on those subjects carried me to the horns a pale alehouse in lane cheapside and introduced me to dr mandeville author of the fable of the bees who had a club there of which he was the soul being a most facetious entertaining companion lyons too introduced me to dr pemberton at batson s coffee house who promis d to give me an opportunity sometime or other of seeing sir isaac newton of which i was extreamly desirous but this never happened i had brought over a few curiosities among which the principal was a purse made of the asbestos which purifies by fire sir hans sloane heard of it came to see me and invited me to his house in bloomsbury square where he show d me all his curiosities and persuaded me to let him add that to the number for which he paid me handsomely in our house there lodg d a young woman a milliner who i think had a shop in the cloisters she had been genteelly bred was sensible and lively and of most pleasing conversation ralph read plays to her in the evenings they grew intimate she took another lodging and he followed her they liv d together some time but he being still out of business and her income not sufficient to maintain them with her child he took a resolution of going from london to try for a country school which he thought himself well qualified to undertake as he wrote an excellent hand and was a master of arithmetic and accounts this however he deemed a business below him and confident of future better fortune when he should be unwilling to have it known that he once was so meanly employed he changed his name and did me the honour to assume mine for i soon after had a letter from him acquainting me that he was settled in a small village in berkshire i think it was where he taught reading and writing to ten or a dozen boys at sixpence each per week recommending mrs t to my care and desiring me to write to him directing for mr franklin schoolmaster at such a place he continued to write frequently sending me large specimens of an epic poem which he was then composing and desiring my remarks and corrections these i gave him from time to time but endeavour d rather to discourage his proceeding one of young s satires was then just published i copy d and sent him a great part of it which set in a strong light the folly of pursuing the muses with any hope of advancement by them all was in vain sheets of the poem continued to come by every post in the meantime mrs t having on his account lost her friends and business was often in distresses and us d to send for me and borrow what i could spare to help her out of them i grew fond of her company and being at that time under no religious restraint and presuming upon my importance to her i attempted familiarities another erratum which she repuls d with a proper resentment and acquainted him with my behaviour this made a breach between us and when he returned again to london he let me know he thought i had cancell d all the obligations he had been under to me so i found i was never to expect his repaying me what i lent to him or advanc d for him this however was not then of much consequence as he was totally unable and in the loss of his friendship i found myself relieved from a burthen i now began to think of getting a little money beforehand and expecting better work i left palmer s to work at watts s near lincoln s inn fields a still greater printing house here i continued all the rest of my stay in london edward young an english poet see his satires vol iii epist ii page the printing press at which franklin worked is preserved in the patent office at washington at my first admission into this printing house i took to working at press imagining i felt a want of the bodily exercise i had been us d to in america where presswork is mix d with composing i drank only water the other workmen near fifty in number were great guzzlers of beer on occasion i carried up and down stairs a large form of types in each hand when others carried but one in both hands they wondered to see from this and several instances that the water american as they called me was stronger than themselves who drank strong beer we had an alehouse boy who attended always in the house to supply the workmen my companion at the press drank every day a pint before breakfast a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese a pint between breakfast and dinner a pint at dinner a pint in the afternoon about six o clock and another when he had done his day s work i thought it a detestable custom but it was necessary he suppos d to drink strong beer that he might be strong to labour i endeavoured to convince him that the bodily strength afforded by beer could only be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barley dissolved in the water of which it was made that there was more flour in a pennyworth of bread and therefore if he would eat that with a pint of water it would give him more strength than a quart of beer he drank on however and had four or five shillings to pay out of his wages every saturday night for that muddling liquor an expense i was free from and thus these poor devils keep themselves always under illustration i took to working at press watts after some weeks desiring to have me in the composing room i left the pressmen a new bien venu or sum for drink being five shillings was demanded of me by the compositors i thought it an imposition as i had paid below the master thought so too and forbade my paying it i stood out two or three weeks was accordingly considered as an excommunicate and had so many little pieces of private mischief done me by mixing my sorts transposing my pages breaking my matter etc etc if i were ever so little out of the room and all ascribed to the chappel ghost which they said ever haunted those not regularly admitted that notwithstanding the master s protection i found myself oblig d to comply and pay the money convinc d of the folly of being on ill terms with those one is to live with continually franklin now left the work of operating the printing presses which was largely a matter of manual labor and began setting type which required more skill and intelligence i was now on a fair footing with them and soon acquir d considerable influence i propos d some reasonable alterations in their chappel laws and carried them against all opposition from my example a great part of them left their muddling breakfast of beer and bread and cheese finding they could with me be supply d from a neighbouring house with a large porringer of hot water gruel sprinkled with pepper crumb d with bread and a bit of butter in it for the price of a pint of beer viz three half pence this was a more comfortable as well as cheaper breakfast and keep their heads clearer those who continued sotting with beer all day were often by not paying out of credit at the alehouse and us d to make interest with me to get beer their light as they phrased it being out i watch d the pay table on saturday night and collected what i stood engag d for them having to pay sometimes near thirty shillings a week on their accounts this and my being esteem d a pretty good riggite that is a jocular verbal satirist supported my consequence in the society my constant attendance i never making a st monday recommended me to the master and my uncommon quickness at composing occasioned my being put upon all work of dispatch which was generally better paid so i went on now very agreeably a printing house is called a chapel because caxton the first english printer did his printing in a chapel connected with westminster abbey a holiday taken to prolong the dissipation of saturday s wages my lodging in little britain being too remote i found another in duke street opposite to the romish chapel it was two pair of stairs backwards at an italian warehouse a widow lady kept the house she had a daughter and a maid servant and a journeyman who attended the warehouse but lodg d abroad after sending to inquire my character at the house where i last lodg d she agreed to take me in at the same rate s d per week cheaper as she said from the protection she expected in having a man lodge in the house she was a widow an elderly woman had been bred a protestant being a clergyman s daughter but was converted to the catholic religion by her husband whose memory she much revered had lived much among people of distinction and knew a thousand anecdotes of them as far back as the times of charles the second she was lame in her knees with the gout and therefore seldom stirred out of her room so sometimes wanted company and hers was so highly amusing to me that i was sure to spend an evening with her whenever she desired it our supper was only half an anchovy each on a very little strip of bread and butter and half a pint of ale between us but the entertainment was in her conversation my always keeping good hours and giving little trouble in the family made her unwilling to part with me so that when i talk d of a lodging i had heard of nearer my business for two shillings a week which intent as i now was on saving money made some difference she bid me not think of it for she would abate me two shillings a week for the future so i remained with her at one shilling and sixpence as long as i staid in london in a garret of her house there lived a maiden lady of seventy in the most retired manner of whom my landlady gave me this account that she was a roman catholic had been sent abroad when young and lodg d in a nunnery with an intent of becoming a nun but the country not agreeing with her she returned to england where there being no nunnery she had vow d to lead the life of a nun as near as might be done in those circumstances accordingly she had given all her estate to charitable uses reserving only twelve pounds a year to live on and out of this sum she still gave a great deal in charity living herself on water gruel only and using no fire but to boil it she had lived many years in that garret being permitted to remain there gratis by successive catholic tenants of the house below as they deemed it a blessing to have her there a priest visited her to confess her every day i have ask d her says my landlady how she as she liv d could possibly find so much employment for a confessor oh said she it is impossible to avoid vain thoughts i was permitted once to visit her she was cheerful and polite and convers d pleasantly the room was clean but had no other furniture than a matras a table with a crucifix and book a stool which she gave me to sit on and a picture over the chimney of saint veronica displaying her handkerchief with the miraculous figure of christ s bleeding face on it which she explained to me with great seriousness she look d pale but was never sick and i give it as another instance on how small an income life and health may be supported at watts s printing house i contracted an acquaintance with an ingenious young man one wygate who having wealthy relations had been better educated than most printers was a tolerable latinist spoke french and lov d reading i taught him and a friend of his to swim at twice going into the river and they soon became good swimmers they introduc d me to some gentlemen from the country who went to chelsea by water to see the college and don saltero s curiosities in our return at the request of the company whose curiosity wygate had excited i stripped and leaped into the river and swam from near chelsea to blackfriar s performing on the way many feats of activity both upon and under water that surpris d and pleas d those to whom they were novelties the story is that she met christ on his way to crucifixion and offered him her handkerchief to wipe the blood from his face after which the handkerchief always bore the image of christ s bleeding face james salter a former servant of hans sloane lived in cheyne walk chelsea his house a barber shop was known as don saltero s coffee house the curiosities were in glass cases and constituted an amazing and motley collection a petrified crab from china a lignified hog job s tears madagascar lances william the conqueror s flaming sword and henry the eighth s coat of mail smyth about three miles i had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise had studied and practis d all thevenot s motions and positions added some of my own aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the useful all these i took this occasion of exhibiting to the company and was much flatter d by their admiration and wygate who was desirous of becoming a master grew more and more attach d to me on that account as well as from the similarity of our studies he at length proposed to me traveling all over europe together supporting ourselves everywhere by working at our business i was once inclined to it but mentioning it to my good friend mr denham with whom i often spent an hour when i had leisure he dissuaded me from it advising me to think only of returning to pennsylvania which he was now about to do i must record one trait of this good man s character he had formerly been in business at bristol but failed in debt to a number of people compounded and went to america there by a close application to business as a merchant he acquired a plentiful fortune in a few years returning to england in the ship with me he invited his old creditors to an entertainment at which he thank d them for the easy composition they had favoured him with and when they expected nothing but the treat every man at the first remove found under his plate an order on a banker for the full amount of the unpaid remainder with interest he now told me he was about to return to philadelphia and should carry over a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there he propos d to take me over as his clerk to keep his books in which he would instruct me copy his letters and attend the store he added that as soon as i should be acquainted with mercantile business he would promote me by sending me with a cargo of flour and bread etc to the west indies and procure me commissions from others which would be profitable and if i manag d well would establish me handsomely the thing pleas d me for i was grown tired of london remembered with pleasure the happy months i had spent in pennsylvania and wish d again to see it therefore i immediately agreed on the terms of fifty pounds a year pennsylvania money less indeed than my present gettings as a compositor but affording a better prospect about i now took leave of printing as i thought forever and was daily employed in my new business going about with mr denham among the tradesmen to purchase various articles and seeing them pack d up doing errands calling upon workmen to dispatch etc and when all was on board i had a few days leisure on one of these days i was to my surprise sent for by a great man i knew only by name a sir william wyndham and i waited upon him he had heard by some means or other of my swimming from chelsea to blackfriars and of my teaching wygate and another young man to swim in a few hours he had two sons about to set out on their travels he wish d to have them first taught swimming and proposed to gratify me handsomely if i would teach them they were not yet come to town and my stay was uncertain so i could not undertake it but from this incident i thought it likely that if i were to remain in england and open a swimming school i might get a good deal of money and it struck me so strongly that had the overture been sooner made me probably i should not so soon have returned to america after many years you and i had something of more importance to do with one of these sons of sir william wyndham become earl of egremont which i shall mention in its place thus i spent about eighteen months in london most part of the time i work d hard at my business and spent but little upon myself except in seeing plays and in books my friend ralph had kept me poor he owed me about twenty seven pounds which i was now never likely to receive a great sum out of my small earnings i lov d him notwithstanding for he had many amiable qualities i had by no means improv d my fortune but i had picked up some very ingenious acquaintance whose conversation was of great advantage to me and i had read considerably vii beginning business in philadelphia we sail d from gravesend on the rd of july for the incidents of the voyage i refer you to my journal where you will find them all minutely related perhaps the most important part of that journal is the plan to be found in it which i formed at sea for regulating my future conduct in life it is the more remarkable as being formed when i was so young and yet being pretty faithfully adhered to quite thro to old age not found in the manuscript journal which was left among franklin s papers bigelow we landed in philadelphia on the th of october where i found sundry alterations keith was no longer governor being superseded by major gordon i met him walking the streets as a common citizen he seem d a little asham d at seeing me but pass d without saying anything i should have been as much asham d at seeing miss read had not her friends despairing with reason of my return after the receipt of my letter persuaded her to marry another one rogers a potter which was done in my absence with him however she was never happy and soon parted from him refusing to cohabit with him or bear his name it being now said that he had another wife he was a worthless fellow tho an excellent workman which was the temptation to her friends he got into debt ran away in or went to the west indies and died there keimer had got a better house a shop well supply d with stationery plenty of new types a number of hands tho none good and seem d to have a great deal of business mr denham took a store in water street where we open d our goods i attended the business diligently studied accounts and grew in a little time expert at selling we lodg d and boarded together he counsell d me as a father having a sincere regard for me i respected and loved him and we might have gone on together very happy but in the beginning of february when i had just pass d my twenty first year we both were taken ill my distemper was a pleurisy which very nearly carried me off i suffered a good deal gave up the point in my own mind and was rather disappointed when i found myself recovering regretting in some degree that i must now some time or other have all that disagreeable work to do over again i forget what his distemper was it held him a long time and at length carried him off he left me a small legacy in a nuncupative will as a token of his kindness for me and he left me once more to the wide world for the store was taken into the care of his executors and my employment under him ended illustration mr denham took a store in water street my brother in law holmes being now at philadelphia advised my return to my business and keimer tempted me with an offer of large wages by the year to come and take the management of his printing house that he might better attend his stationer s shop i had heard a bad character of him in london from his wife and her friends and was not fond of having any more to do with him i tri d for farther employment as a merchant s clerk but not readily meeting with any i clos d again with keimer i found in his house these hands hugh meredith a welsh pennsylvanian thirty years of age bred to country work honest sensible had a great deal of solid observation was something of a reader but given to drink stephen potts a young countryman of full age bred to the same of uncommon natural parts and great wit and humor but a little idle these he had agreed with at extream low wages per week to be rais d a shilling every three months as they would deserve by improving in their business and the expectation of these high wages to come on hereafter was what he had drawn them in with meredith was to work at press potts at book binding which he by agreement was to teach them though he knew neither one nor t other john a wild irishman brought up to no business whose service for four years keimer had purchased from the captain of a ship he too was to be made a pressman george webb an oxford scholar whose time for four years he had likewise bought intending him for a compositor of whom more presently and david harry a country boy whom he had taken apprentice i soon perceiv d that the intention of engaging me at wages so much higher than he had been us d to give was to have these raw cheap hands form d thro me and as soon as i had instructed them then they being all articled to him he should be able to do without me i went on however very chearfully put his printing house in order which had been in great confusion and brought his hands by degrees to mind their business and to do it better it was an odd thing to find an oxford scholar in the situation of a bought servant he was not more than eighteen years of age and gave me this account of himself that he was born in gloucester educated at a grammar school there had been distinguish d among the scholars for some apparent superiority in performing his part when they exhibited plays belong d to the witty club there and had written some pieces in prose and verse which were printed in the gloucester newspapers thence he was sent to oxford where he continued about a year but not well satisfi d wishing of all things to see london and become a player at length receiving his quarterly allowance of fifteen guineas instead of discharging his debts he walk d out of town hid his gown in a furze bush and footed it to london where having no friend to advise him he fell into bad company soon spent his guineas found no means of being introduc d among the players grew necessitous pawn d his cloaths and wanted bread walking the street very hungry and not knowing what to do with himself a crimp s bill was put into his hand offering immediate entertainment and encouragement to such as would bind themselves to serve in america he went directly sign d the indentures was put into the ship and came over never writing a line to acquaint his friends what was become of him he was lively witty good natur d and a pleasant companion but idle thoughtless and imprudent to the last degree a crimp was the agent of a shipping company crimps were sometimes employed to decoy men into such service as is here mentioned john the irishman soon ran away with the rest i began to live very agreeably for they all respected me the more as they found keimer incapable of instructing them and that from me they learned something daily we never worked on saturday that being keimer s sabbath so i had two days for reading my acquaintance with ingenious people in the town increased keimer himself treated me with great civility and apparent regard and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to vernon which i was yet unable to pay being hitherto but a poor economist he however kindly made no demand of it our printing house often wanted sorts and there was no letter founder in america i had seen types cast at james s in london but without much attention to the manner however i now contrived a mould made use of the letters we had as puncheons struck the mattrices in lead and thus supply d in a pretty tolerable way all deficiencies i also engrav d several things on occasion i made the ink i was warehouseman and everything and in short quite a fac totum but however serviceable i might be i found that my services became every day of less importance as the other hands improv d in the business and when keimer paid my second quarter s wages he let me know that he felt them too heavy and thought i should make an abatement he grew by degrees less civil put on more of the master frequently found fault was captious and seem d ready for an outbreaking i went on nevertheless with a good deal of patience thinking that his encumber d circumstances were partly the cause at length a trifle snapt our connections for a great noise happening near the court house i put my head out of the window to see what was the matter keimer being in the street look d up and saw me call d out to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business adding some reproachful words that nettled me the more for their publicity all the neighbours who were looking out on the same occasion being witnesses how i was treated he came up immediately into the printing house continu d the quarrel high words pass d on both sides he gave me the quarter s warning we had stipulated expressing a wish that he had not been oblig d to so long a warning i told him his wish was unnecessary for i would leave him that instant and so taking my hat walk d out of doors desiring meredith whom i saw below to take care of some things i left and bring them to my lodgings meredith came accordingly in the evening when we talked my affair over he had conceiv d a great regard for me and was very unwilling that i should leave the house while he remain d in it he dissuaded me from returning to my native country which i began to think of he reminded me that keimer was in debt for all he possess d that his creditors began to be uneasy that he kept his shop miserably sold often without profit for ready money and often trusted without keeping accounts that he must therefore fail which would make a vacancy i might profit of i objected my want of money he then let me know that his father had a high opinion of me and from some discourse that had pass d between them he was sure would advance money to set us up if i would enter into partnership with him my time says he will be out with keimer in the spring by that time we may have our press and types in from london i am sensible i am no workman if you like it your skill in the business shall be set against the stock i furnish and we will share the profits equally the proposal was agreeable and i consented his father was in town and approv d of it the more as he saw i had great influence with his son had prevailed on him to abstain long from dram drinking and he hop d might break him of that wretched habit entirely when we came to be so closely connected i gave an inventory to the father who carry d it to a merchant the things were sent for the secret was to be kept till they should arrive and in the meantime i was to get work if i could at the other printing house but i found no vacancy there and so remained idle a few days when keimer on a prospect of being employ d to print some paper money in new jersey which would require cuts and various types that i only could supply and apprehending bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him sent me a very civil message that old friends should not part for a few words the effect of sudden passion and wishing me to return meredith persuaded me to comply as it would give more opportunity for his improvement under my daily instructions so i return d and we went on more smoothly than for some time before the new jersey jobb was obtained i contriv d a copperplate press for it the first that had been seen in the country i cut several ornaments and checks for the bills we went together to burlington where i executed the whole to satisfaction and he received so large a sum for the work as to be enabled thereby to keep his head much longer above water at burlington i made an acquaintance with many principal people of the province several of them had been appointed by the assembly a committee to attend the press and take care that no more bills were printed than the law directed they were therefore by turns constantly with us and generally he who attended brought with him a friend or two for company my mind having been much more improv d by reading than keimer s i suppose it was for that reason my conversation seem d to be more valu d they had me to their houses introduced me to their friends and show d me much civility while he tho the master was a little neglected in truth he was an odd fish ignorant of common life fond of rudely opposing receiv d opinions slovenly to extream dirtiness enthusiastic in some points of religion and a little knavish withal we continu d there near three months and by that time i could reckon among my acquired friends judge allen samuel bustill the secretary of the province isaac pearson joseph cooper and several of the smiths members of assembly and isaac decow the surveyor general the latter was a shrewd sagacious old man who told me that he began for himself when young by wheeling clay for brick makers learned to write after he was of age carri d the chain for surveyors who taught him surveying and he had now by his industry acquir d a good estate and says he i foresee that you will soon work this man out of his business and make a fortune in it at philadelphia he had not then the least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere these friends were afterwards of great use to me as i occasionally was to some of them they all continued their regard for me as long as they lived before i enter upon my public appearance in business it may be well to let you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principles and morals that you may see how far those influenc d the future events of my life my parents had early given me religious impressions and brought me through my childhood piously in the dissenting way but i was scarce fifteen when after doubting by turns of several points as i found them disputed in the different books i read i began to doubt of revelation itself some books against deism fell into my hands they were said to be the substance of sermons preached at boyle s lectures it happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them for the arguments of the deists which were quoted to be refuted appeared to me much stronger than the refutations in short i soon became a thorough deist my arguments perverted some others particularly collins and ralph but each of them having afterwards wrong d me greatly without the least compunction and recollecting keith s conduct towards me who was another free thinker and my own towards vernon and miss read which at times gave me great trouble i began to suspect that this doctrine tho it might be true was not very useful my london pamphlet which had for its motto these lines of dryden whatever is is right though purblind man sees but a part o the chain the nearest link his eyes not carrying to the equal beam that poises all above and from the attributes of god his infinite wisdom goodness and power concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world and that vice and virtue were empty distinctions no such things existing appear d now not so clever a performance as i once thought it and i doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself unperceiv d into my argument so as to infect all that follow d as is common in metaphysical reasonings the creed of an eighteenth century theological sect which while believing in god refused to credit the possibility of miracles and to acknowledge the validity of revelation a great english poet dramatist and critic the lines are inaccurately quoted from dryden s oedipus act iii scene i line i grew convinc d that truth sincerity and integrity in dealings between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of life and i form d written resolutions which still remain in my journal book to practice them ever while i lived revelation had indeed no weight with me as such but i entertain d an opinion that though certain actions might not be bad because they were forbidden by it or good because it commanded them yet probably these actions might be forbidden because they were bad for us or commanded because they were beneficial to us in their own natures all the circumstances of things considered and this persuasion with the kind hand of providence or some guardian angel or accidental favourable circumstances and situations or all together preserved me thro this dangerous time of youth and the hazardous situations i was sometimes in among strangers remote from the eye and advice of my father without any willful gross immorality or injustice that might have been expected from my want of religion i say willful because the instances i have mentioned had something of necessity in them from my youth inexperience and the knavery of others i had therefore a tolerable character to begin the world with i valued it properly and determin d to preserve it we had not been long return d to philadelphia before the new types arriv d from london we settled with keimer and left him by his consent before he heard of it we found a house to hire near the market and took it to lessen the rent which was then but twenty four pounds a year tho i have since known it to let for seventy we took in thomas godfrey a glazier and his family who were to pay a considerable part of it to us and we to board with them we had scarce opened our letters and put our press in order before george house an acquaintance of mine brought a countryman to us whom he had met in the street inquiring for a printer all our cash was now expended in the variety of particulars we had been obliged to procure and this countryman s five shillings being our first fruits and coming so seasonably gave me more pleasure than any crown i have since earned and the gratitude i felt toward house has made me often more ready than perhaps i should otherwise have been to assist young beginners there are croakers in every country always boding its ruin such a one then lived in philadelphia a person of note an elderly man with a wise look and a very grave manner of speaking his name was samuel mickle this gentleman a stranger to me stopt one day at my door and asked me if i was the young man who had lately opened a new printing house being answered in the affirmative he said he was sorry for me because it was an expensive undertaking and the expense would be lost for philadelphia was a sinking place the people already half bankrupts or near being so all appearances to the contrary such as new buildings and the rise of rents being to his certain knowledge fallacious for they were in fact among the things that would soon ruin us and he gave me such a detail of misfortunes now existing or that were soon to exist that he left me half melancholy had i known him before i engaged in this business probably i never should have done it this man continued to live in this decaying place and to declaim in the same strain refusing for many years to buy a house there because all was going to destruction and at last i had the pleasure of seeing him give five times as much for one as he might have bought it for when he first began his croaking i should have mentioned before that in the autumn of the preceding year i had form d most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement which was called the junto we met on friday evenings the rules that i drew up required that every member in his turn should produce one or more queries on any point of morals politics or natural philosophy to be discuss d by the company and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing on any subject he pleased our debates were to be under the direction of a president and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth without fondness for dispute or desire of victory and to prevent warmth all expressions of positiveness in opinions or direct contradiction were after some time made contraband and prohibited under small pecuniary penalties a spanish term meaning a combination for political intrigue here a club or society the first members were joseph breintnal a copyer of deeds for the scriveners a good natur d friendly middle ag d man a great lover of poetry reading all he could meet with and writing some that was tolerable very ingenious in many little nicknackeries and of sensible conversation thomas godfrey a self taught mathematician great in his way and afterward inventor of what is now called hadley s quadrant but he knew little out of his way and was not a pleasing companion as like most great mathematicians i have met with he expected universal precision in everything said or was forever denying or distinguishing upon trifles to the disturbance of all conversation he soon left us nicholas scull a surveyor afterwards surveyor general who lov d books and sometimes made a few verses william parsons bred a shoemaker but loving reading had acquir d a considerable share of mathematics which he first studied with a view to astrology that he afterwards laught at it he also became surveyor general william maugridge a joiner a most exquisite mechanic and a solid sensible man hugh meredith stephen potts and george webb i have characteriz d before robert grace a young gentleman of some fortune generous lively and witty a lover of punning and of his friends and william coleman then a merchant s clerk about my age who had the coolest clearest head the best heart and the exactest morals of almost any man i ever met with he became afterwards a merchant of great note and one of our provincial judges our friendship continued without interruption to his death upwards of forty years and the club continued almost as long and was the best school of philosophy morality and politics that then existed in the province for our queries which were read the week preceding their discussion put us upon reading with attention upon the several subjects that we might speak more to the purpose and here too we acquired better habits of conversation everything being studied in our rules which might prevent our disgusting each other from hence the long continuance of the club which i shall have frequent occasion to speak further of hereafter but my giving this account of it here is to show something of the interest i had everyone of these exerting themselves in recommending business to us breintnal particularly procur d us from the quakers the printing forty sheets of their history the rest being to be done by keimer and upon this we work d exceedingly hard for the price was low it was a folio pro patria size in pica with long primer notes i compos d of it a sheet a day and meredith worked it off at press it was often eleven at night and sometimes later before i had finished my distribution for the next day s work for the little jobbs sent in by our other friends now and then put us back but so determin d i was to continue doing a sheet a day of the folio that one night when having impos d my forms i thought my day s work over one of them by accident was broken and two pages reduced to pi i immediately distribut d and composed it over again before i went to bed and this industry visible to our neighbors began to give us character and credit particularly i was told that mention being made of the new printing office at the merchants every night club the general opinion was that it must fail there being already two printers in the place keimer and bradford but dr baird whom you and i saw many years after at his native place st andrew s in scotland gave a contrary opinion for the industry of that franklin says he is superior to anything i ever saw of the kind i see him still at work when i go home from club and he is at work again before his neighbors are out of bed this struck the rest and we soon after had offers from one of them to supply us with stationery but as yet we did not chuse to engage in shop business a sheet by inches having the words pro patria in translucent letters in the body of the paper pica a size of type as a b c d long primer a smaller size of type as a b c d to arrange and lock up pages or columns of type in a rectangular iron frame ready for printing reduced to complete disorder i mention this industry the more particularly and the more freely tho it seems to be talking in my own praise that those of my posterity who shall read it may know the use of that virtue when they see its effects in my favour throughout this relation george webb who had found a female friend that lent him wherewith to purchase his time of keimer now came to offer himself as a journeyman to us we could not then employ him but i foolishly let him know as a secret that i soon intended to begin a newspaper and might then have work for him my hopes of success as i told him were founded on this that the then only newspaper printed by bradford was a paltry thing wretchedly manag d no way entertaining and yet was profitable to him i therefore thought a good paper would scarcely fail of good encouragement i requested webb not to mention it but he told it to keimer who immediately to be beforehand with me published proposals for printing one himself on which webb was to be employ d i resented this and to counteract them as i could not yet begin our paper i wrote several pieces of entertainment for bradford s paper under the title of the busy body which breintnal continu d some months by this means the attention of the publick was fixed on that paper and keimer s proposals which we burlesqu d and ridicul d were disregarded he began his paper however and after carrying it on three quarters of a year with at most only ninety subscribers he offered it to me for a trifle and i having been ready some time to go on with it took it in hand directly and it prov d in a few years extremely profitable to me i perceive that i am apt to speak in the singular number though our partnership still continu d the reason may be that in fact the whole management of the business lay upon me meredith was no compositor a poor pressman and seldom sober my friends lamented my connection with him but i was to make the best of it illustration i see him still at work when i go home from club our first papers made a quite different appearance from any before in the province a better type and better printed but some spirited remarks of my writing on the dispute then going on between governor burnet and the massachusetts assembly struck the principal people occasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talk d of and in a few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers their example was follow d by many and our number went on growing continually this was one of the first good effects of my having learnt a little to scribble another was that the leading men seeing a newspaper now in the hands of one who could also handle a pen thought it convenient to oblige and encourage me bradford still printed the votes and laws and other publick business he had printed an address of the house to the governor in a coarse blundering manner we reprinted it elegantly and correctly and sent one to every member they were sensible of the difference it strengthened the hands of our friends in the house and they voted us their printers for the year ensuing among my friends in the house i must not forget mr hamilton before mentioned who was then returned from england and had a seat in it he interested himself for me strongly in that instance as he did in many others afterward continuing his patronage till his death i got his son once marg note mr vernon about this time put me in mind of the debt i ow d him but did not press me i wrote him an ingenuous letter of acknowledgment crav d his forbearance a little longer which he allow d me and as soon as i was able i paid the principal with interest and many thanks so that erratum was in some degree corrected but now another difficulty came upon me which i had never the least reason to expect mr meredith s father who was to have paid for our printing house according to the expectations given me was able to advance only one hundred pounds currency which had been paid and a hundred more was due to the merchant who grew impatient and su d us all we gave bail but saw that if the money could not be rais d in time the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution and our hopeful prospects must with us be ruined as the press and letters must be sold for payment perhaps at half price in this distress two true friends whose kindness i have never forgotten nor ever shall forget while i can remember any thing came to me separately unknown to each other and without any application from me offering each of them to advance me all the money that should be necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself if that should be practicable but they did not like my continuing the partnership with meredith who as they said was often seen drunk in the streets and playing at low games in alehouses much to our discredit these two friends were william coleman and robert grace i told them i could not propose a separation while any prospect remain d of the meredith s fulfilling their part of our agreement because i thought myself under great obligations to them for what they had done and would do if they could but if they finally fail d in their performance and our partnership must be dissolv d i should then think myself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends thus the matter rested for some time when i said to my partner perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertaken in this affair of ours and is unwilling to advance for you and me what he would for you alone if that is the case tell me and i will resign the whole to you and go about my business no said he my father has really been disappointed and is really unable and i am unwilling to distress him farther i see this is a business i am not fit for i was bred a farmer and it was a folly in me to come to town and put myself at thirty years of age an apprentice to learn a new trade many of our welsh people are going to settle in north carolina where land is cheap i am inclin d to go with them and follow my old employment you may find friends to assist you if you will take the debts of the company upon you return to my father the hundred pounds he has advanced pay my little personal debts and give me thirty pounds and a new saddle i will relinquish the partnership and leave the whole in your hands i agreed to this proposal it was drawn up in writing sign d and seal d immediately i gave him what he demanded and he went soon after to carolina from whence he sent me next year two long letters containing the best account that had been given of that country the climate the soil husbandry etc for in those matters he was very judicious i printed them in the papers and they gave great satisfaction to the publick as soon as he was gone i recurr d to my two friends and because i would not give an unkind preference to either i took half of what each had offered and i wanted of one and half of the other paid off the company s debts and went on with the business in my own name advertising that the partnership was dissolved i think this was in or about the year viii business success and first public service about this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money only fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the province and that soon to be sunk the wealthy inhabitants oppos d any addition being against all paper currency from an apprehension that it would depreciate as it had done in new england to the prejudice of all creditors we had discuss d this point in our junto where i was on the side of an addition being persuaded that the first small sum struck in had done much good by increasing the trade employment and number of inhabitants in the province since i now saw all the old houses inhabited and many new ones building whereas i remembered well that when i first walk d about the streets of philadelphia eating my roll i saw most of the houses in walnut street between second and front streets with bills on their doors to be let and many likewise in chestnut street and other streets which made me then think the inhabitants of the city were deserting it one after another recalled to be redeemed this part of philadelphia is now the center of the wholesale business district our debates possess d me so fully of the subject that i wrote and printed an anonymous pamphlet on it entitled the nature and necessity of a paper currency it was well receiv d by the common people in general but the rich men dislik d it for it increas d and strengthen d the clamor for more money and they happening to have no writers among them that were able to answer it their opposition slacken d and the point was carried by a majority in the house my friends there who conceiv d i had been of some service thought fit to reward me by employing me in printing the money a very profitable jobb and a great help to me this was another advantage gain d by my being able to write the utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident as never afterwards to be much disputed so that it grew soon to fifty five thousand pounds and in to eighty thousand pounds since which it arose during war to upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds trade building and inhabitants all the while increasing tho i now think there are limits beyond which the quantity may be hurtful paper money is a promise to pay its face value in gold or silver when a state or nation issues more such promises than there is a likelihood of its being able to redeem the paper representing the promises depreciates in value before the success of the colonies in the revolution was assured it took hundreds of dollars of their paper money to buy a pair of boots i soon after obtain d thro my friend hamilton the printing of the newcastle paper money another profitable jobb as i then thought it small things appearing great to those in small circumstances and these to me were really great advantages as they were great encouragements he procured for me also the printing of the laws and votes of that government which continu d in my hands as long as i follow d the business i now open d a little stationer s shop i had in it blanks of all sorts the correctest that ever appear d among us being assisted in that by my friend breintnal i had also paper parchment chapmen s books etc one whitemash a compositor i had known in london an excellent workman now came to me and work d with me constantly and diligently and i took an apprentice the son of aquilla rose illustration i sometimes brought home the paper i purchas d at the stores thro the streets on a wheelbarrow i began now gradually to pay off the debt i was under for the printing house in order to secure my credit and character as a tradesman i took care not only to be in reality industrious and frugal but to avoid all appearances to the contrary i drest plainly i was seen at no places of idle diversion i never went out a fishing or shooting a book indeed sometimes debauch d me from my work but that was seldom snug and gave no scandal and to show that i was not above my business i sometimes brought home the paper i purchas d at the stores thro the streets on a wheelbarrow thus being esteem d an industrious thriving young man and paying duly for what i bought the merchants who imported stationery solicited my custom others proposed supplying me with books and i went on swimmingly in the meantime keimer s credit and business declining daily he was at last forc d to sell his printing house to satisfy his creditors he went to barbadoes and there lived some years in very poor circumstances his apprentice david harry whom i had instructed while i work d with him set up in his place at philadelphia having bought his materials i was at first apprehensive of a powerful rival in harry as his friends were very able and had a good deal of interest i therefore propos d a partnership to him which he fortunately for me rejected with scorn he was very proud dress d like a gentleman liv d expensively took much diversion and pleasure abroad ran in debt and neglected his business upon which all business left him and finding nothing to do he followed keimer to barbadoes taking the printing house with him there this apprentice employ d his former master as a journeyman they quarrell d often harry went continually behindhand and at length was forc d to sell his types and return to his country work in pennsylvania the person that bought them employ d keimer to use them but in a few years he died there remained now no competitor with me at philadelphia but the old one bradford who was rich and easy did a little printing now and then by straggling hands but was not very anxious about the business however as he kept the post office it was imagined he had better opportunities of obtaining news his paper was thought a better distributer of advertisements than mine and therefore had many more which was a profitable thing to him and a disadvantage to me for tho i did indeed receive and send papers by the post yet the publick opinion was otherwise for what i did send was by bribing the riders who took them privately bradford being unkind enough to forbid it which occasion d some resentment on my part and i thought so meanly of him for it that when i afterward came into his situation i took care never to imitate it i had hitherto continu d to board with godfrey who lived in part of my house with his wife and children and had one side of the shop for his glazier s business tho he worked little being always absorbed in his mathematics mrs godfrey projected a match for me with a relation s daughter took opportunities of bringing us often together till a serious courtship on my part ensu d the girl being in herself very deserving the old folks encourag d me by continual invitations to supper and by leaving us together till at length it was time to explain mrs godfrey manag d our little treaty i let her know that i expected as much money with their daughter as would pay off my remaining debt for the printing house which i believe was not then above a hundred pounds she brought me word they had no such sum to spare i said they might mortgage their house in the loan office the answer to this after some days was that they did not approve the match that on inquiry of bradford they had been informed the printing business was not a profitable one the types would soon be worn out and more wanted that s keimer and d harry had failed one after the other and i should probably soon follow them and therefore i was forbidden the house and the daughter shut up whether this was a real change of sentiment or only artifice on a supposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract and therefore that we should steal a marriage which would leave them at liberty to give or withhold what they pleas d i know not but i suspected the latter resented it and went no more mrs godfrey brought me afterward some more favorable accounts of their disposition and would have drawn me on again but i declared absolutely my resolution to have nothing more to do with that family this was resented by the godfreys we differed and they removed leaving me the whole house and i resolved to take no more inmates but this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage i look d round me and made overtures of acquaintance in other places but soon found that the business of a printer being generally thought a poor one i was not to expect money with a wife unless with such a one as i should not otherwise think agreeable a friendly correspondence as neighbours and old acquaintances had continued between me and mrs read s family who all had a regard for me from the time of my first lodging in their house i was often invited there and consulted in their affairs wherein i sometimes was of service i piti d poor miss read s unfortunate situation who was generally dejected seldom chearful and avoided company i considered my giddiness and inconstancy when in london as in a great degree the cause of her unhappiness tho the mother was good enough to think the fault more her own than mine as she had prevented our marrying before i went thither and persuaded the other match in my absence our mutual affection was revived but there were now great objections to our union the match was indeed looked upon as invalid a preceding wife being said to be living in england but this could not easily be prov d because of the distance and tho there was a report of his death it was not certain then tho it should be true he had left many debts which his successor might be call d upon to pay we ventured however over all these difficulties and i took her to wife september st none of the inconveniences happened that we had apprehended she proved a good and faithful helpmate assisted me much by attending the shop we throve together and have ever mutually endeavour d to make each other happy thus i corrected that great erratum as well as i could mrs franklin survived her marriage over forty years franklin s correspondence abounds with evidence that their union was a happy one we are grown old together and if she has any faults i am so used to them that i don t perceive them the following is a stanza from one of franklin s own songs written for the junto of their chloes and phyllises poets may prate i sing my plain country joan these twelve years my wife still the joy of my life blest day that i made her my own about this time our club meeting not at a tavern but in a little room of mr grace s set apart for that purpose a proposition was made by me that since our books were often referr d to in our disquisitions upon the queries it might be convenient to us to have them altogether where we met that upon occasion they might be consulted and by thus clubbing our books to a common library we should while we lik d to keep them together have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole it was lik d and agreed to and we fill d one end of the room with such books as we could best spare the number was not so great as we expected and tho they had been of great use yet some inconveniences occurring for want of due care of them the collection after about a year was separated and each took his books home again and now i set on foot my first project of a public nature that for a subscription library i drew up the proposals got them put into form by our great scrivener brockden and by the help of my friends in the junto procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each to begin with and ten shillings a year for fifty years the term our company was to continue we afterwards obtain d a charter the company being increased to one hundred this was the mother of all the north american subscription libraries now so numerous it is become a great thing itself and continually increasing these libraries have improved the general conversation of the americans made the common tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other countries and perhaps have contributed in some degree to the stand so generally made throughout the colonies in defense of their privileges mem thus far was written with the intention express d in the beginning and therefore contains several little family anecdotes of no importance to others what follows was written many years after in compliance with the advice contain d in these letters and accordingly intended for the public the affairs of the revolution occasion d the interruption here the first part of the autobiography written at twyford in ends the second part which follows was written at passy in after this memorandum franklin inserted letters from abel james and benjamin vaughan urging him to continue his autobiography continuation of the account of my life begun at passy near paris it is some time since i receiv d the above letters but i have been too busy till now to think of complying with the request they contain it might too be much better done if i were at home among my papers which would aid my memory and help to ascertain dates but my return being uncertain and having just now a little leisure i will endeavour to recollect and write what i can if i live to get home it may there be corrected and improv d not having any copy here of what is already written i know not whether an account is given of the means i used to establish the philadelphia public library which from a small beginning is now become so considerable though i remember to have come down to near the time of that transaction i will therefore begin here with an account of it which may be struck out if found to have been already given at the time i establish d myself in pennsylvania there was not a good bookseller s shop in any of the colonies to the southward of boston in new york and philad a the printers were indeed stationers they sold only paper etc almanacs ballads and a few common school books those who lov d reading were obliged to send for their books from england the members of the junto had each a few we had left the alehouse where we first met and hired a room to hold our club in i propos d that we should all of us bring our books to that room where they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences but become a common benefit each of us being at liberty to borrow such as he wish d to read at home this was accordingly done and for some time contented us finding the advantage of this little collection i propos d to render the benefit from books more common by commencing a public subscription library i drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would be necessary and got a skilful conveyancer mr charles brockden to put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed by which each subscriber engag d to pay a certain sum down for the first purchase of books and an annual contribution for increasing them so few were the readers at that time in philadelphia and the majority of us so poor that i was not able with great industry to find more than fifty persons mostly young tradesmen willing to pay down for this purpose forty shillings each and ten shillings per annum on this little fund we began the books were imported the library was opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers on their promissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned the institution soon manifested its utility was imitated by other towns and in other provinces the libraries were augmented by donations reading became fashionable and our people having no publick amusements to divert their attention from study became better acquainted with books and in a few years were observ d by strangers to be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the same rank generally are in other countries when we were about to sign the above mentioned articles which were to be binding on us our heirs etc for fifty years mr brockden the scrivener said to us you are young men but it is scarcely probable that any of you will live to see the expiration of the term fix d in the instrument a number of us however are yet living but the instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter that incorporated and gave perpetuity to the company the objections and reluctances i met with in soliciting the subscriptions made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one s self as the proposer of any useful project that might be suppos d to raise one s reputation in the smallest degree above that of one s neighbours when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project i therefore put myself as much as i could out of sight and stated it as a scheme of a number of friends who had requested me to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading in this way my affair went on more smoothly and i ever after practis d it on such occasions and from my frequent successes can heartily recommend it the present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid if it remains a while uncertain to whom the merit belongs someone more vain than yourself will be encouraged to claim it and then even envy will be disposed to do you justice by plucking those assumed feathers and restoring them to their right owner this library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study for which i set apart an hour or two each day and thus repair d in some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me reading was the only amusement i allow d myself i spent no time in taverns games or frolicks of any kind and my industry in my business continu d as indefatigable as it was necessary i was indebted for my printing house i had a young family coming on to be educated and i had to contend with for business two printers who were established in the place before me my circumstances however grew daily easier my original habits of frugality continuing and my father having among his instructions to me when a boy frequently repeated a proverb of solomon seest thou a man diligent in his calling he shall stand before kings he shall not stand before mean men i from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth and distinction which encourag d me tho i did not think that i should ever literally stand before kings which however has since happened for i have stood before five and even had the honor of sitting down with one the king of denmark to dinner we have an english proverb that says he that would thrive must ask his wife it was lucky for me that i had one as much dispos d to industry and frugality as myself she assisted me chearfully in my business folding and stitching pamphlets tending shop purchasing old linen rags for the paper makers etc etc we kept no idle servants our table was plain and simple our furniture of the cheapest for instance my breakfast was a long time break and milk no tea and i ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer with a pewter spoon but mark how luxury will enter families and make a progress in spite of principle being call d one morning to breakfast i found it in a china bowl with a spoon of silver they had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife and had cost her the enormous sum of three and twenty shillings for which she had no other excuse or apology to make but that she thought her husband deserv d a silver spoon and china bowl as well as any of his neighbors this was the first appearance of plate and china in our house which afterward in a course of years as our wealth increas d augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value i had been religiously educated as a presbyterian and though some of the dogmas of that persuasion such as the eternal decrees of god election reprobation etc appeared to me unintelligible others doubtful and i early absented myself from the public assemblies of the sect sunday being my studying day i never was without some religious principles i never doubted for instance the existence of the deity that he made the world and govern d it by his providence that the most acceptable service of god was the doing good to man that our souls are immortal and that all crime will be punished and virtue rewarded either here or hereafter these i esteem d the essentials of every religion and being to be found in all the religions we had in our country i respected them all tho with different degrees of respect as i found them more or less mix d with other articles which without any tendency to inspire promote or confirm morality serv d principally to divide us and make us unfriendly to one another this respect to all with an opinion that the worst had some good effects induc d me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessen the good opinion another might have of his own religion and as our province increas d in people and new places of worship were continually wanted and generally erected by voluntary contribution my mite for such purpose whatever might be the sect was never refused tho i seldom attended any public worship i had still an opinion of its propriety and of its utility when rightly conducted and i regularly paid my annual subscription for the support of the only presbyterian minister or meeting we had in philadelphia he us d to visit me sometimes as a friend and admonished me to attend his administrations and i was now and then prevail d on to do so once for five sundays successively had he been in my opinion a good preacher perhaps i might have continued notwithstanding the occasion i had for the sunday s leisure in my course of study but his discourses were chiefly either polemic arguments or explications of the peculiar doctrines of our sect and were all to me very dry uninteresting and unedifying since not a single moral principle was inculcated or enforc d their aim seeming to be rather to make us presbyterians than good citizens franklin expressed a different view about the duty of attending church later at length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of philippians finally brethren whatsoever things are true honest just pure lovely or of good report if there be any virtue or any praise think on these things and i imagin d in a sermon on such a text we could not miss of having some morality but he confin d himself to five points only as meant by the apostle viz keeping holy the sabbath day being diligent in reading the holy scriptures attending duly the publick worship partaking of the sacrament paying a due respect to god s ministers these might be all good things but as they were not the kind of good things that i expected from that text i despaired of ever meeting with them from any other was disgusted and attended his preaching no more i had some years before compos d a little liturgy or form of prayer for my own private use viz in entitled articles of belief and acts of religion i return d to the use of this and went no more to the public assemblies my conduct might be blameable but i leave it without attempting further to excuse it my present purpose being to relate facts and not to make apologies for them ix plan for attaining moral perfection it was about this time i conceived the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection i wish d to live without committing any fault at any time i would conquer all that either natural inclination custom or company might lead me into as i knew or thought i knew what was right and wrong i did not see why i might not always do the one and avoid the other but i soon found i had undertaken a task of more difficulty than i had imagined while my care was employ d in guarding against one fault i was often surprised by another habit took the advantage of inattention inclination was sometimes too strong for reason i concluded at length that the mere speculative conviction that it was our interest to be completely virtuous was not sufficient to prevent our slipping and that the contrary habits must be broken and good ones acquired and established before we can have any dependence on a steady uniform rectitude of conduct for this purpose i therefore contrived the following method compare philippians iv in the various enumerations of the moral virtues i had met with in my reading i found the catalogue more or less numerous as different writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name temperance for example was by some confined to eating and drinking while by others it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure appetite inclination or passion bodily or mental even to our avarice and ambition i propos d to myself for the sake of clearness to use rather more names with fewer ideas annex d to each than a few names with more ideas and i included under thirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurr d to me as necessary or desirable and annexed to each a short precept which fully express d the extent i gave to its meaning these names of virtues with their precepts were temperance eat not to dullness drink not to elevation silence speak not but what may benefit others or yourself avoid trifling conversation order let all your things have their places let each part of your business have its time resolution resolve to perform what you ought perform without fail what you resolve frugality make no expense but to do good to others or yourself i e waste nothing industry lose no time be always employ d in something useful cut off all unnecessary actions sincerity use no hurtful deceit think innocently and justly and if you speak speak accordingly justice wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are your duty moderation avoid extreams forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve cleanliness tolerate no uncleanliness in body cloaths or habitation tranquillity be not disturbed at trifles or at accidents common or unavoidable chastity humility imitate jesus and socrates my intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues i judg d it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the whole at once but to fix it on one of them at a time and when i should be master of that then to proceed to another and so on till i should have gone thro the thirteen and as the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others i arrang d them with that view as they stand above temperance first as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept up and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits and the force of perpetual temptations this being acquir d and establish d silence would be more easy and my desire being to gain knowledge at the same time that i improv d in virtue and considering that in conversation it was obtain d rather by the use of the ears than of the tongue and therefore wishing to break a habit i was getting into of prattling punning and joking which only made me acceptable to trifling company i gave silence the second place this and the next order i expected would allow me more time for attending to my project and my studies resolution once become habitual would keep me firm in my endeavours to obtain all the subsequent virtues frugality and industry freeing me from my remaining debt and producing affluence and independence would make more easy the practice of sincerity and justice etc etc conceiving then that agreeably to the advice of pythagoras in his golden verses daily examination would be necessary i contrived the following method for conducting that examination i made a little book in which i allotted a page for each of the virtues i rul d each page with red ink so as to have seven columns one for each day of the week marking each column with a letter for the day i cross d these columns with thirteen red lines marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues on which line and in its proper column i might mark by a little black spot every fault i found upon examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day a famous greek philosopher who lived about b c the golden verses here ascribed to him are probably of later origin the time which he recommends for this work is about even or bed time that we may conclude the action of the day with the judgment of conscience making the examination of our conversation an evening song to god this little book is dated july w t f form of the pages temperance eat not to dullness drink not to elevation temperance eat not to dullness drink not to elevation s m t w t f s t s o r f i s j m c t c i determined to give a week s strict attention to each of the virtues successively thus in the first week my great guard was to avoid every the least offense against temperance leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance only marking every evening the faults of the day thus if in the first week i could keep my first line marked t clear of spots i suppos d the habit of that virtue so much strengthen d and its opposite weaken d that i might venture extending my attention to include the next and for the following week keep both lines clear of spots proceeding thus to the last i could go thro a course compleat in thirteen weeks and four courses in a year and like him who having a garden to weed does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once which would exceed his reach and his strength but works on one of the beds at a time and having accomplish d the first proceeds to a second so i should have i hoped the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress i made in virtue by clearing successively my lines of their spots till in the end by a number of courses i should be happy in viewing a clean book after a thirteen weeks daily examination this my little book had for its motto these lines from addison s cato here will i hold if there s a power above us and that there is all nature cries aloud thro all her works he must delight in virtue and that which he delights in must be happy another from cicero o vite philosophia dux o virtutum indagatrix expultrixque vitiorum unus dies bene et ex preceptis tuis actus peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus o philosophy guide of life o searcher out of virtue and exterminator of vice one day spent well and in accordance with thy precepts is worth an immortality of sin tusculan inquiries book v another from the proverbs of solomon speaking of wisdom or virtue length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honour her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace iii and conceiving god to be the fountain of wisdom i thought it right and necessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it to this end i formed the following little prayer which was prefix d to my tables of examination for daily use o powerful goodness bountiful father merciful guide increase in me that wisdom which discovers my truest interest strengthen my resolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates accept my kind offices to thy other children as the only return in my power for thy continual favours to me i used also sometimes a little prayer which i took from thomson s poems viz father of light and life thou good supreme o teach me what is good teach me thyself save me from folly vanity and vice from every low pursuit and fill my soul with knowledge conscious peace and virtue pure sacred substantial never fading bliss the precept of order requiring that every part of my business should have its allotted time one page in my little book contain d the following scheme of employment for the twenty four hours of a natural day rise wash and address powerful goodness the morning contrive day s question what good business and take the shall i do this day resolution of the day prosecute the present study and breakfast work noon read or overlook my accounts and dine work evening put things in their question what good places supper music have i done to day or diversion or conversation examination of the day night sleep i enter d upon the execution of this plan for self examination and continu d it with occasional intermissions for some time i was surpris d to find myself so much fuller of faults than i had imagined but i had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish to avoid the trouble of renewing now and then my little book which by scraping out the marks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in a new course became full of holes i transferr d my tables and precepts to the ivory leaves of a memorandum book on which the lines were drawn with red ink that made a durable stain and on those lines i mark d my faults with a black lead pencil which marks i could easily wipe out with a wet sponge after a while i went thro one course only in a year and afterward only one in several years till at length i omitted them entirely being employ d in voyages and business abroad with a multiplicity of affairs that interfered but i always carried my little book with me my scheme of order gave me the most trouble and i found that tho it might be practicable where a man s business was such as to leave him the disposition of his time that of a journeyman printer for instance it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master who must mix with the world and often receive people of business at their own hours order too with regard to places for things papers etc i found extreamly difficult to acquire i had not been early accustomed to it and having an exceeding good memory i was not so sensible of the inconvenience attending want of method this article therefore cost me so much painful attention and my faults in it vexed me so much and i made so little progress in amendment and had such frequent relapses that i was almost ready to give up the attempt and content myself with a faulty character in that respect like the man who in buying an ax of a smith my neighbour desired to have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge the smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel he turn d while the smith press d the broad face of the ax hard and heavily on the stone which made the turning of it very fatiguing the man came every now and then from the wheel to see how the work went on and at length would take his ax as it was without farther grinding no said the smith turn on turn on we shall have it bright by and by as yet it is only speckled yes says the man but i think i like a speckled ax best and i believe this may have been the case with many who having for want of some such means as i employ d found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad habits in other points of vice and virtue have given up the struggle and concluded that a speckled ax was best for something that pretended to be reason was every now and then suggesting to me that such extream nicety as i exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals which if it were known would make me ridiculous that a perfect character might be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and hated and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself to keep his friends in countenance illustration the smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel professor mcmaster tells us that when franklin was american agent in france his lack of business order was a source of annoyance to his colleagues and friends strangers who came to see him were amazed to behold papers of the greatest importance scattered in the most careless way over the table and floor in truth i found myself incorrigible with respect to order and now i am grown old and my memory bad i feel very sensibly the want of it but on the whole tho i never arrived at the perfection i had been so ambitious of obtaining but fell far short of it yet i was by the endeavour a better and a happier man than i otherwise should have been if i had not attempted it as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies tho they never reach the wish d for excellence of those copies their hand is mended by the endeavour and is tolerable while it continues fair and legible it may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little artifice with the blessing of god their ancestor ow d the constant felicity of his life down to his th year in which this is written what reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of providence but if they arrive the reflection on past happiness enjoy d ought to help his bearing them with more resignation to temperance he ascribes his long continued health and what is still left to him of a good constitution to industry and frugality the early easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune with all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful citizen and obtained for him some degree of reputation among the learned to sincerity and justice the confidence of his country and the honorable employs it conferred upon him and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues even in the imperfect state he was able to acquire them all that evenness of temper and that cheerfulness in conversation which makes his company still sought for and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance i hope therefore that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit while there can be no question that franklin s moral improvement and happiness were due to the practice of these virtues yet most people will agree that we shall have to go back of his plan for the impelling motive to a virtuous life franklin s own suggestion that the scheme smacks of foppery in morals seems justified woodrow wilson well puts it men do not take fire from such thoughts unless something deeper which is missing here shine through them what may have seemed to the eighteenth century a system of morals seems to us nothing more vital than a collection of the precepts of good sense and sound conduct what redeems it from pettiness in this book is the scope of power and of usefulness to be seen in franklin himself who set these standards up in all seriousness and candor for his own life see galatians chapter v for the christian plan of moral perfection it will be remark d that tho my scheme was not wholly without religion there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets of any particular sect i had purposely avoided them for being fully persuaded of the utility and excellency of my method and that it might be serviceable to people in all religions and intending some time or other to publish it i would not have anything in it that should prejudice anyone of any sect against it i purposed writing a little comment on each virtue in which i would have shown the advantages of possessing it and the mischiefs attending its opposite vice and i should have called my book the art of virtue because it would have shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue which would have distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good that does not instruct and indicate the means but is like the apostle s man of verbal charity who only without showing to the naked and hungry how or where they might get clothes or victuals exhorted them to be fed and clothed james ii nothing so likely to make a man s fortune as virtue marg note but it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this comment was never fulfilled i did indeed from time to time put down short hints of the sentiments reasonings etc to be made use of in it some of which i have still by me but the necessary close attention to private business in the earlier part of my life and public business since have occasioned my postponing it for it being connected in my mind with a great and extensive project that required the whole man to execute and which an unforeseen succession of employs prevented my attending to it has hitherto remain d unfinish d in this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden but forbidden because they are hurtful the nature of man alone considered that it was therefore everyone s interest to be virtuous who wish d to be happy even in this world and i should from this circumstance there being always in the world a number of rich merchants nobility states and princes who have need of honest instruments for the management of their affairs and such being so rare have endeavoured to convince young persons that no qualities were so likely to make a poor man s fortune as those of probity and integrity my list of virtues contain d at first but twelve but a quaker friend having kindly informed me that i was generally thought proud that my pride show d itself frequently in conversation that i was not content with being in the right when discussing any point but was overbearing and rather insolent of which he convinc d me by mentioning several instances i determined endeavouring to cure myself if i could of this vice or folly among the rest and i added humility to my list giving an extensive meaning to the word i cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this virtue but i had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it i made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of others and all positive assertion of my own i even forbid myself agreeably to the old laws of our junto the use of every word or expression in the language that imported a fix d opinion such as certainly undoubtedly etc and i adopted instead of them i conceive i apprehend or i imagine a thing to be so or so or it so appears to me at present when another asserted something that i thought an error i deny d myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition and in answering i began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right but in the present case there appear d or seem d to me some difference etc i soon found the advantage of this change in my manner the conversations i engag d in went on more pleasantly the modest way in which i propos d my opinions procur d them a readier reception and less contradiction i had less mortification when i was found to be in the wrong and i more easily prevail d with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when i happened to be in the right and this mode which i at first put on with some violence to natural inclination became at length so easy and so habitual to me that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression escape me and to this habit after my character of integrity i think it principally owing that i had early so much weight with my fellow citizens when i proposed new institutions or alterations in the old and so much influence in public councils when i became a member for i was but a bad speaker never eloquent subject to much hesitation in my choice of words hardly correct in language and yet i generally carried my points in reality there is perhaps no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride disguise it struggle with it beat it down stifle it mortify it as much as one pleases it is still alive and will every now and then peep out and show itself you will see it perhaps often in this history for even if i could conceive that i had compleatly overcome it i should probably be proud of my humility thus far written at passy i am now about to write at home august but cannot have the help expected from my papers many of them being lost in the war i have however found the following this is a marginal memorandum b having mentioned a great and extensive project which i had conceiv d it seems proper that some account should be here given of that project and its object its first rise in my mind appears in the following little paper accidentally preserv d viz observations on my reading history in library may th that the great affairs of the world the wars revolutions etc are carried on and effected by parties that the view of these parties is their present general interest or what they take to be such that the different views of these different parties occasion all confusion that while a party is carrying on a general design each man has his particular private interest in view that as soon as a party has gain d its general point each member becomes intent upon his particular interest which thwarting others breaks that party into divisions and occasions more confusion that few in public affairs act from a mere view of the good of their country whatever they may pretend and tho their actings bring real good to their country yet men primarily considered that their own and their country s interest was united and did not act from a principle of benevolence that fewer still in public affairs act with a view to the good of mankind there seems to me at present to be great occasion for raising a united party for virtue by forming the virtuous and good men of all nations into a regular body to be govern d by suitable good and wise rules which good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in their obedience to than common people are to common laws i at present think that whoever attempts this aright and is well qualified cannot fail of pleasing god and of meeting with success b f revolving this project in my mind as to be undertaken hereafter when my circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure i put down from time to time on pieces of paper such thoughts as occurr d to me respecting it most of these are lost but i find one purporting to be the substance of an intended creed containing as i thought the essentials of every known religion and being free of everything that might shock the professors of any religion it is express d in these words viz that there is one god who made all things that he governs the world by his providence that he ought to be worshiped by adoration prayer and thanksgiving but that the most acceptable service of god is doing good to man that the soul is immortal and that god will certainly reward virtue and punish vice either here or hereafter my ideas at that time were that the sect should be begun and spread at first among young and single men only that each person to be initiated should not only declare his assent to such creed but should have exercised himself with the thirteen weeks examination and practice of the virtues as in the beforemention d model that the existence of such a society should be kept a secret till it was become considerable to prevent solicitations for the admission of improper persons but that the members should each of them search among his acquaintance for ingenuous well disposed youths to whom with prudent caution the scheme should be gradually communicated that the members should engage to afford their advice assistance and support to each other in promoting one another s interests business and advancement in life that for distinction we should be call d the society of the free and easy free as being by the general practice and habit of the virtues free from the dominion of vice and particularly by the practice of industry and frugality free from debt which exposes a man to confinement and a species of slavery to his creditors this is as much as i can now recollect of the project except that i communicated it in part to two young men who adopted it with some enthusiasm but my then narrow circumstances and the necessity i was under of sticking close to my business occasioned my postponing the further prosecution of it at that time and my multifarious occupations public and private induc d me to continue postponing so that it has been omitted till i have no longer strength or activity left sufficient for such an enterprise though i am still of opinion that it was a practicable scheme and might have been very useful by forming a great number of good citizens and i was not discourag d by the seeming magnitude of the undertaking as i have always thought that one man of tolerable abilities may work great changes and accomplish great affairs among mankind if he first forms a good plan and cutting off all amusements or other employments that would divert his attention makes the execution of that same plan his sole study and business x poor richard s almanac and other activities in i first publish d my almanack under the name of richard saunders it was continu d by me about twenty five years commonly call d poor richard s almanac i endeavour d to make it both entertaining and useful and it accordingly came to be in such demand that i reap d considerable profit from it vending annually near ten thousand and observing that it was generally read scarce any neighborhood in the province being without it i consider d it as a proper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common people who bought scarcely any other books i therefore filled all the little spaces that occurr d between the remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial sentences chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality as the means of procuring wealth and thereby securing virtue it being more difficult for a man in want to act always honestly as to use here one of those proverbs it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright the almanac at that time was a kind of periodical as well as a guide to natural phenomena and the weather franklin took his title

nations i assembled and form d into a connected discourse prefix d to the almanack of as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending an auction the bringing all these scatter d councils thus into a focus enabled them to make greater impression the piece being universally approved was copied in all the newspapers of the continent reprinted in britain on a broadside to be stuck up in houses two translations were made of it in french and great numbers bought by the clergy and gentry to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants in pennsylvania as it discouraged

composed for reading in our junto of these are a socratic dialogue tending to prove that whatever might be his parts and abilities a vicious man could not properly be called a man of sense and a discourse on self denial showing that virtue was not secure till its practice became a habitude and was free from the opposition of contrary inclinations these may be found in the papers about the beginning of june and july smyth in the conduct of my newspaper i carefully excluded all libeling and personal abuse which is of late years become so disgraceful to our country whenever i was solicited to insert anything of that kind and the writers pleaded as they generally did the liberty of the press and that a newspaper was like a stage coach in which anyone who would pay had a right to a place my answer was that i would print the piece separately if desired and the author might have as many copies as he pleased to distribute himself but that i would not take upon me to spread his detraction and that having contracted with my subscribers to furnish them with what might be either useful or entertaining i could not fill their papers with private altercation in which they had no concern without doing them manifest injustice now many of our printers make no scruple of gratifying the malice of individuals by false accusations of the fairest characters among ourselves augmenting animosity even to the producing of duels and are moreover so indiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on the government of neighboring states and even on the conduct of our best national allies which may be attended with the most pernicious consequences these things i mention as a caution to young printers and that they may be encouraged not to pollute their presses and disgrace their profession by such infamous practices but refuse steadily as they may see by my example that such a course of conduct will not on the whole be injurious to their interests in i sent one of my journeymen to charleston south carolina where a printer was wanting i furnish d him with a press and letters on an agreement of partnership by which i was to receive one third of the profits of the business paying one third of the expense he was a man of learning and honest but ignorant in matters of account and tho he sometimes made me remittances i could get no account from him nor any satisfactory state of our partnership while he lived on his decease the business was continued by his widow who being born and bred in holland where as i have been inform d the knowledge of accounts makes a part of female education she not only sent me as clear a state as she could find of the transactions past but continued to account with the greatest regularity and exactness every quarter afterwards and managed the business with such success that she not only brought up reputably a family of children but at the expiration of the term was able to purchase of me the printing house and establish her son in it i mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branch of education for our young females as likely to be of more use to them and their children in case of widowhood than either music or dancing by preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men and enabling them to continue perhaps a profitable mercantile house with establish d correspondence till a son is grown up fit to undertake and go on with it to the lasting advantage and enriching of the family about the year there arrived among us from ireland a young presbyterian preacher named hemphill who delivered with a good voice and apparently extempore most excellent discourses which drew together considerable numbers of different persuasions who join d in admiring them among the rest i became one of his constant hearers his sermons pleasing me as they had little of the dogmatical kind but inculcated strongly the practice of virtue or what in the religious stile are called good works those however of our congregation who considered themselves as orthodox presbyterians disapprov d his doctrine and were join d by most of the old clergy who arraign d him of heterodoxy before the synod in order to have him silenc d i became his zealous partisan and contributed all i could to raise a party in his favour and we combated for him awhile with some hopes of success there was much scribbling pro and con upon the occasion and finding that tho an elegant preacher he was but a poor writer i lent him my pen and wrote for him two or three pamphlets and one piece in the gazette of april those pamphlets as is generally the case with controversial writings tho eagerly read at the time were soon out of vogue and i question whether a single copy of them now exists see a list of books written by or relating to benjamin franklin by paul leicester ford p smyth during the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly one of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that was much admired thought he had somewhere read the sermon before or at least a part of it on search he found that part quoted at length in one of the british reviews from a discourse of dr foster s this detection gave many of our party disgust who accordingly abandoned his cause and occasion d our more speedy discomfiture in the synod i stuck by him however as i rather approv d his giving us good sermons composed by others than bad ones of his own manufacture tho the latter was the practice of our common teachers he afterward acknowledg d to me that none of those he preach d were his own adding that his memory was such as enabled him to retain and repeat any sermon after one reading only on our defeat he left us in search elsewhere of better fortune and i quitted the congregation never joining it after tho i continu d many years my subscription for the support of its ministers dr james foster let modest foster if he will excel ten metropolitans in preaching well pope epilogue to the satires i those who had not heard farinelli sing and foster preach were not qualified to appear in genteel company hawkins history of music smyth i had begun in to study languages i soon made myself so much a master of the french as to be able to read the books with ease i then undertook the italian an acquaintance who was also learning it us d often to tempt me to play chess with him finding this took up too much of the time i had to spare for study i at length refus d to play any more unless on this condition that the victor in every game should have a right to impose a task either in parts of the grammar to be got by heart or in translations etc which tasks the vanquish d was to perform upon honour before our next meeting as we play d pretty equally we thus beat one another into that language i afterwards with a little painstaking acquir d as much of the spanish as to read their books also i have already mention d that i had only one year s instruction in a latin school and that when very young after which i neglected that language entirely but when i had attained an acquaintance with the french italian and spanish i was surpris d to find on looking over a latin testament that i understood so much more of that language than i had imagined which encouraged me to apply myself again to the study of it and i met with more success as those preceding languages had greatly smooth d my way from these circumstances i have thought that there is some inconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages we are told that it is proper to begin first with the latin and having acquir d that it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are deriv d from it and yet we do not begin with the greek in order more easily to acquire the latin it is true that if you can clamber and get to the top of a staircase without using the steps you will more easily gain them in descending but certainly if you begin with the lowest you will with more ease ascend to the top and i would therefore offer it to the consideration of those who superintend the education of our youth whether since many of those who begin with the latin quit the same after spending some years without having made any great proficiency and what they have learnt becomes almost useless so that their time has been lost it would not have been better to have begun with the french proceeding to the italian etc for tho after spending the same time they should quit the study of languages and never arrive at the latin they would however have acquired another tongue or two that being in modern use might be serviceable to them in common life the authority of franklin the most eminently practical man of his age in favor of reserving the study of the dead languages until the mind has reached a certain maturity is confirmed by the confession of one of the most eminent scholars of any age our seminaries of learning says gibbon do not exactly correspond with the precept of a spartan king that the child should be instructed in the arts which will be useful to the man since a finished scholar may emerge from the head of westminster or eton in total ignorance of the business and conversation of english gentlemen in the latter end of the eighteenth century but these schools may assume the merit of teaching all that they pretend to teach the latin and greek languages bigelow after ten years absence from boston and having become easy in my circumstances i made a journey thither to visit my relations which i could not sooner well afford in returning i call d at newport to see my brother then settled there with his printing house our former differences were forgotten and our meeting was very cordial and affectionate he was fast declining in his health and requested of me that in case of his death which he apprehended not far distant i would take home his son then but ten years of age and bring him up to the printing business this i accordingly perform d sending him a few years to school before i took him into the office his mother carried on the business till he was grown up when i assisted him with an assortment of new types those of his father being in a manner worn out thus it was that i made my brother ample amends for the service i had depriv d him of by leaving him so early illustration our former differences were forgotten and our meeting was very cordial and affectionate in i lost one of my sons a fine boy of four years old by the small pox taken in the common way i long regretted bitterly and still regret that i had not given it to him by inoculation this i mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it my example showing that the regret may be the same either way and that therefore the safer should be chosen our club the junto was found so useful and afforded such satisfaction to the members that several were desirous of introducing their friends which could not well be done without exceeding what we had settled as a convenient number viz twelve we had from the beginning made it a rule to keep our institution a secret which was pretty well observ d the intention was to avoid applications of improper persons for admittance some of whom perhaps we might find it difficult to refuse i was one of those who were against any addition to our number but instead of it made in writing a proposal that every member separately should endeavour to form a subordinate club with the same rules respecting queries etc and without informing them of the connection with the junto the advantages proposed were the improvement of so many more young citizens by the use of our institutions our better acquaintance with the general sentiments of the inhabitants on any occasion as the junto member might propose what queries we should desire and was to report to the junto what pass d in his separate club the promotion of our particular interests in business by more extensive recommendation and the increase of our influence in public affairs and our power of doing good by spreading thro the several clubs the sentiments of the junto the project was approv d and every member undertook to form his club but they did not all succeed five or six only were compleated which were called by different names as the vine the union the band etc they were useful to themselves and afforded us a good deal of amusement information and instruction besides answering in some considerable degree our views of influencing the public opinion on particular occasions of which i shall give some instances in course of time as they happened my first promotion was my being chosen in clerk of the general assembly the choice was made that year without opposition but the year following when i was again propos d the choice like that of the members being annual a new member made a long speech against me in order to favour some other candidate i was however chosen which was the more agreeable to me as besides the pay for the immediate service as clerk the place gave me a better opportunity of keeping up an interest among the members which secur d to me the business of printing the votes laws paper money and other occasional jobbs for the public that on the whole were very profitable i therefore did not like the opposition of this new member who was a gentleman of fortune and education with talents that were likely to give him in time great influence in the house which indeed afterwards happened i did not however aim at gaining his favour by paying any servile respect to him but after some time took this other method having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and curious book i wrote a note to him expressing my desire of perusing that book and requesting he would do me the favour of lending it to me for a few days he sent it immediately and i return d it in about a week with another note expressing strongly my sense of the favour when we next met in the house he spoke to me which he had never done before and with great civility and he ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions so that we became great friends and our friendship continued to his death this is another instance of the truth of an old maxim i had learned which says he that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged and it shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove than to resent return and continue inimical proceedings in colonel spotswood late governor of virginia and then postmaster general being dissatisfied with the conduct of his deputy at philadelphia respecting some negligence in rendering and inexactitude of his accounts took from him the commission and offered it to me i accepted it readily and found it of great advantage for tho the salary was small it facilitated the correspondence that improv d my newspaper increas d the number demanded as well as the advertisements to be inserted so that it came to afford me a considerable income my old competitor s newspaper declin d proportionately and i was satisfy d without retaliating his refusal while postmaster to permit my papers being carried by the riders thus he suffer d greatly from his neglect in due accounting and i mention it as a lesson to those young men who may be employ d in managing affairs for others that they should always render accounts and make remittances with great clearness and punctuality the character of observing such a conduct is the most powerful of all recommendations to new employments and increase of business xi interest in public affairs i began now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs beginning however with small matters the city watch was one of the first things that i conceiv d to want regulation it was managed by the constables of the respective wards in turn the constable warned a number of housekeepers to attend him for the night those who chose never to attend paid him six shillings a year to be excus d which was suppos d to be for hiring substitutes but was in reality much more than was necessary for that purpose and made the constableship a place of profit and the constable for a little drink often got such ragamuffins about him as a watch that respectable housekeepers did not choose to mix with walking the rounds too was often neglected and most of the nights spent in tippling i thereupon wrote a paper to be read in junto representing these irregularities but insisting more particularly on the inequality of this six shilling tax of the constables respecting the circumstances of those who paid it since a poor widow housekeeper all whose property to be guarded by the watch did not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds paid as much as the wealthiest merchant who had thousands of pounds worth of goods in his stores on the whole i proposed as a more effectual watch the hiring of proper men to serve constantly in that business and as a more equitable way of supporting the charge the levying a tax that should be proportion d to the property this idea being approv d by the junto was communicated to the other clubs but as arising in each of them and though the plan was not immediately carried into execution yet by preparing the minds of people for the change it paved the way for the law obtained a few years after when the members of our clubs were grown into more influence about this time i wrote a paper first to be read in junto but it was afterward publish d on the different accidents and carelessnesses by which houses were set on fire with cautions against them and means proposed of avoiding them this was much spoken of as a useful piece and gave rise to a project which soon followed it of forming a company for the more ready extinguishing of fires and mutual assistance in removing and securing of goods when in danger associates in this scheme were presently found amounting to thirty our articles of agreement oblig d every member to keep always in good order and fit for use a certain number of leather buckets with strong bags and baskets for packing and transporting of goods which were to be brought to every fire and we agreed to meet once a month and spend a social evening together in discoursing and communicating such ideas as occurred to us upon the subjects of fires as might be useful in our conduct on such occasions the utility of this institution soon appeared and many more desiring to be admitted than we thought convenient for one company they were advised to form another which was accordingly done and this went on one new company being formed after another till they became so numerous as to include most of the inhabitants who were men of property and now at the time of my writing this tho upward of fifty years since its establishment that which i first formed called the union fire company still subsists and flourishes tho the first members are all deceas d but myself and one who is older by a year than i am the small fines that have been paid by members for absence at the monthly meetings have been apply d to the purchase of fire engines ladders fire hooks and other useful implements for each company so that i question whether there is a city in the world better provided with the means of putting a stop to beginning conflagrations and in fact since these institutions the city has never lost by fire more than one or two houses at a time and the flames have often been extinguished before the house in which they began has been half consumed illustration the flames have often been extinguished in arrived among us from ireland the reverend mr whitefield who had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher he was at first permitted to preach in some of our churches but the clergy taking a dislike to him soon refus d him their pulpits and he was oblig d to preach in the fields the multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous and it was matter of speculation to me who was one of the number to observe the extraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers and how much they admir d and respected him notwithstanding his common abuse of them by assuring them they were naturally half beasts and half devils it was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants from being thoughtless or indifferent about religion it seem d as if all the world were growing religious so that one could not walk thro the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families of every street george whitefield pronounced hwit field a celebrated english clergyman and pulpit orator one of the founders of methodism and it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air subject to its inclemencies the building of a house to meet in was no sooner propos d and persons appointed to receive contributions but sufficient sums were soon receiv d to procure the ground and erect the building which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad about the size of westminster hall and the work was carried on with such spirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than could have been expected both house and ground were vested in trustees expressly for the use of any preacher of any religious persuasion who might desire to say something to the people at philadelphia the design in building not being to accommodate any particular sect but the inhabitants in general so that even if the mufti of constantinople were to send a missionary to preach mohammedanism to us he would find a pulpit at his service a part of the palace of westminster now forming the vestibule to the houses of parliament in london mr whitefield in leaving us went preaching all the way thro the colonies to georgia the settlement of that province had lately been begun but instead of being made with hardy industrious husbandmen accustomed to labour the only people fit for such an enterprise it was with families of broken shop keepers and other insolvent debtors many of indolent and idle habits taken out of the jails who being set down in the woods unqualified for clearing land and unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement perished in numbers leaving many helpless children unprovided for the sight of their miserable situation inspir d the benevolent heart of mr whitefield with the idea of building an orphan house there in which they might be supported and educated returning northward he preach d up this charity and made large collections for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the hearts and purses of his hearers of which i myself was an instance i did not disapprove of the design but as georgia was then destitute of materials and workmen and it was proposed to send them from philadelphia at a great expense i thought it would have been better to have built the house here and brought the children to it this i advis d but he was resolute in his first project rejected my counsel and i therefore refus d to contribute i happened soon after to attend one of his sermons in the course of which i perceived he intended to finish with a collection and i silently resolved he should get nothing from me i had in my pocket a handful of copper money three or four silver dollars and five pistoles in gold as he proceeded i began to soften and concluded to give the coppers another stroke of his oratory made me asham d of that and determin d me to give the silver and he finish d so admirably that i empty d my pocket wholly into the collector s dish gold and all at this sermon there was also one of our club who being of my sentiments respecting the building in georgia and suspecting a collection might be intended had by precaution emptied his pockets before he came from home towards the conclusion of the discourse however he felt a strong desire to give and apply d to a neighbour who stood near him to borrow some money for the purpose the application was unfortunately made to perhaps the only man in the company who had the firmness not to be affected by the preacher his answer was at any other time friend hopkinson i would lend to thee freely but not now for thee seems to be out of thy right senses some of mr whitefield s enemies affected to suppose that he would apply these collections to his own private emolument but i who was intimately acquainted with him being employed in printing his sermons and journals etc never had the least suspicion of his integrity but am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct a perfectly honest man and methinks my testimony in his favour ought to have the more weight as we had no religious connection he us d indeed sometimes to pray for my conversion but never had the satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard ours was a mere civil friendship sincere on both sides and lasted to his death the following instance will show something of the terms on which we stood upon one of his arrivals from england at boston he wrote to me that he should come soon to philadelphia but knew not where he could lodge when there as he understood his old friend and host mr benezet was removed to germantown my answer was you know my house if you can make shift with its scanty accommodations you will be most heartily welcome he reply d that if i made that kind offer for christ s sake i should not miss of a reward and i returned don t let me be mistaken it was not for christ s sake but for your sake one of our common acquaintance jocosely remark d that knowing it to be the custom of the saints when they received any favour to shift the burden of the obligation from off their own shoulders and place it in heaven i had contriv d to fix it on earth the last time i saw mr whitefield was in london when he consulted me about his orphan house concern and his purpose of appropriating it to the establishment of a college he had a loud and clear voice and articulated his words and sentences so perfectly that he might be heard and understood at a great distance especially as his auditories however numerous observ d the most exact silence he preach d one evening from the top of the courthouse steps which are in the middle of market street and on the west side of second street which crosses it at right angles both streets were fill d with his hearers to a considerable distance being among the hindmost in market street i had the curiosity to learn how far he could be heard by retiring backwards down the street towards the river and i found his voice distinct till i came near front street when some noise in that street obscur d it imagining then a semicircle of which my distance should be the radius and that it were fill d with auditors to each of whom i allow d two square feet i computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty thousand this reconcil d me to the newspaper accounts of his having preach d to twenty five thousand people in the fields and to the ancient histories of generals haranguing whole armies of which i had sometimes doubted by hearing him often i came to distinguish easily between sermons newly compos d and those which he had often preach d in the course of his travels his delivery of the latter was so improv d by frequent repetitions that every accent every emphasis every modulation of voice was so perfectly well turn d and well plac d that without being interested in the subject one could not help being pleas d with the discourse a pleasure of much the same kind with that receiv d from an excellent piece of musick this is an advantage itinerant preachers have over those who are stationary as the latter cannot well improve their delivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals his writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage to his enemies unguarded expressions and even erroneous opinions delivered in preaching might have been afterwards explain d or qualifi d by supposing others that might have accompani d them or they might have been deny d but litera scripta manet critics attack d his writings violently and with so much appearance of reason as to diminish the number of his votaries and prevent their increase so that i am of opinion if he had never written anything he would have left behind him a much more numerous and important sect and his reputation might in that case have been still growing even after his death as there being nothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give him a lower character his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign for him as great a variety of excellences as their enthusiastic admiration might wish him to have possessed my business was now continually augmenting and my circumstances growing daily easier my newspaper having become very profitable as being for a time almost the only one in this and the neighbouring provinces i experienced too the truth of the observation that after getting the first hundred pound it is more easy to get the second money itself being of a prolific nature the partnership at carolina having succeeded i was encourag d to engage in others and to promote several of my workmen who had behaved well by establishing them with printing houses in different colonies on the same terms with that in carolina most of them did well being enabled at the end of our term six years to purchase the types of me and go on working for themselves by which means several families were raised partnerships often finish in quarrels but i was happy in this that mine were all carried on and ended amicably owing i think a good deal to the precaution of having very explicitly settled in our articles everything to be done by or expected from each partner so that there was nothing to dispute which precaution i would therefore recommend to all who enter into partnerships for whatever esteem partners may have for and confidence in each other at the time of the contract little jealousies and disgusts may arise with ideas of inequality in the care and burden of the business etc which are attended often with breach of friendship and of the connection perhaps with lawsuits and other disagreeable consequences xii defense of the province i had on the whole abundant reason to be satisfied with my being established in pennsylvania there were however two things that i regretted there being no provision for defense nor for a compleat education of youth no militia nor any college i therefore in drew up a proposal for establishing an academy and at that time thinking the reverend mr peters who was out of employ a fit person to superintend such an institution i communicated the project to him but he having more profitable views in the service of the proprietaries which succeeded declin d the undertaking and not knowing another at that time suitable for such a trust i let the scheme lie awhile dormant i succeeded better the next year in proposing and establishing a philosophical society the paper i wrote for that purpose will be found among my writings when collected with respect to defense spain having been several years at war against great britain and being at length join d by france which brought us into great danger and the laboured and long continued endeavour of our governor thomas to prevail with our quaker assembly to pass a militia law and make other provisions for the security of the province having proved abortive i determined to try what might be done by a voluntary association of the people to promote this i first wrote and published a pamphlet entitled plain truth in which i stated our defenceless situation in strong lights with the necessity of union and discipline for our defense and promis d to propose in a few days an association to be generally signed for that purpose the pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect i was call d upon for the instrument of association and having settled the draft of it with a few friends i appointed a meeting of the citizens in the large building before mentioned the house was pretty full i had prepared a number of printed copies and provided pens and ink dispers d all over the room i harangued them a little on the subject read the paper and explained it and then distributed the copies which were eagerly signed not the least objection being made when the company separated and the papers were collected we found above twelve hundred hands and other copies being dispersed in the country the subscribers amounted at length to upward of ten thousand these all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms formed themselves into companies and regiments chose their own officers and met every week to be instructed in the manual exercise and other parts of military discipline the women by subscriptions among themselves provided silk colours which they presented to the companies painted with different devices and mottos which i supplied illustration one of the flags of the pennsylvania association designed by franklin and made by the women of philadelphia the officers of the companies composing the philadelphia regiment being met chose me for their colonel but conceiving myself unfit i declin d that station and recommended mr lawrence a fine person and man of influence who was accordingly appointed i then propos d a lottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town and furnishing it with cannon it filled expeditiously and the battery was soon erected the merlons being fram d of logs and fill d with earth we bought some old cannon from boston but these not being sufficient we wrote to england for more soliciting at the same time our proprietaries for some assistance tho without much expectation of obtaining it meanwhile colonel lawrence william allen abram taylor esqr and myself were sent to new york by the associators commission d to borrow some cannon of governor clinton he at first refus d us peremptorily but at dinner with his council where there was great drinking of madeira wine as the custom of that place then was he softened by degrees and said he would lend us six after a few more bumpers he advanc d to ten and at length he very good naturedly conceded eighteen they were fine cannon eighteen pounders with their carriages which we soon transported and mounted on our battery where the associators kept a nightly guard while the war lasted and among the rest i regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier illustration i regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier my activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and council they took me into confidence and i was consulted by them in every measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the association calling in the aid of religion i propos d to them the proclaiming a fast to promote reformation and implore the blessing of heaven on our undertaking they embrac d the motion but as it was the first fast ever thought of in the province the secretary had no precedent from which to draw the proclamation my education in new england where a fast is proclaimed every year was here of some advantage i drew it in the accustomed stile it was translated into german printed in both languages and divulg d thro the province this gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing their congregations to join in the association and it would probably have been general among all but quakers if the peace had not soon interven d wm penn s agents sought recruits for the colony of pennsylvania in the low countries of germany and there are still in eastern pennsylvania many germans inaccurately called pennsylvania dutch many of them use a germanized english it was thought by some of my friends that by my activity in these affairs i should offend that sect and thereby lose my interest in the assembly of the province where they formed a great majority a young gentleman who had likewise some friends in the house and wished to succeed me as their clerk acquainted me that it was decided to displace me at the next election and he therefore in good will advis d me to resign as more consistent with my honour than being turn d out my answer to him was that i had read or heard of some public man who made it a rule never to ask for an office and never to refuse one when offer d to him i approve says i of his rule and will practice it with a small addition i shall never ask never refuse nor ever resign an office if they will have my office of clerk to dispose of to another they shall take it from me i will not by giving it up lose my right of some time or other making reprisals on my adversaries i heard however no more of this i was chosen again unanimously as usual at the next election possibly as they dislik d my late intimacy with the members of council who had join d the governors in all the disputes about military preparations with which the house had long been harass d they might have been pleas d if i would voluntarily have left them but they did not care to displace me on account merely of my zeal for the association and they could not well give another reason indeed i had some cause to believe that the defense of the country was not disagreeable to any of them provided they were not requir d to assist in it and i found that a much greater number of them than i could have imagined tho against offensive war were clearly for the defensive many pamphlets pro and con were publish d on the subject and some by good quakers in favour of defense which i believe convinc d most of their younger people a transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their prevailing sentiments it had been propos d that we should encourage the scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock then about sixty pounds in tickets of the lottery by our rules no money could be dispos d of till the next meeting after the proposal the company consisted of thirty members of which twenty two were quakers and eight only of other persuasions we eight punctually attended the meeting but tho we thought that some of the quakers would join us we were by no means sure of a majority only one quaker mr james morris appear d to oppose the measure he expressed much sorrow that it had ever been propos d as he said friends were all against it and it would create such discord as might break up the company we told him that we saw no reason for that we were the minority and if friends were against the measure and outvoted us we must and should agreeably to the usage of all societies submit when the hour for business arriv d it was mov d to put the vote he allow d we might then do it by the rules but as he could assure us that a number of members intended to be present for the purpose of opposing it it would be but candid to allow a little time for their appearing while we were disputing this a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen below desir d to speak with me i went down and found they were two of our quaker members they told me there were eight of them assembled at a tavern just by that they were determin d to come and vote with us if there should be occasion which they hop d would not be the case and desir d we would not call for their assistance if we could do without it as their voting for such a measure might embroil them with their elders and friends being thus secure of a majority i went up and after a little seeming hesitation agreed to a delay of another hour this mr morris allow d to be extreamly fair not one of his opposing friends appear d at which he express d great surprize and at the expiration of the hour we carri d the resolution eight to one and as of the twenty two quakers eight were ready to vote with us and thirteen by their absence manifested that they were not inclin d to oppose the measure i afterward estimated the proportion of quakers sincerely against defense as one to twenty one only for these were all regular members of that society and in good reputation among them and had due notice of what was propos d at that meeting the honorable and learned mr logan who had always been of that sect was one who wrote an address to them declaring his approbation of defensive war and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments he put into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for the battery with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn wholly to that service he told me the following anecdote of his old master william penn respecting defense he came over from england when a young man with that proprietary and as his secretary it was war time and their ship was chas d by an armed vessel suppos d to be an enemy their captain prepar d for defense but told william penn and his company of quakers that he did not expect their assistance and they might retire into the cabin which they did except james logan who chose to stay upon deck and was quarter d to a gun the suppos d enemy prov d a friend so there was no fighting but when the secretary went down to communicate the intelligence william penn rebuk d him severely for staying upon deck and undertaking to assist in defending the vessel contrary to the principles of friends especially as it had not been required by the captain this reproof being before all the company piqu d the secretary who answer d i being thy servant why did thee not order me to come down but thee was willing enough that i should stay and help to fight the ship when thee thought there was danger james logan came to america with william penn in and was the business agent for the penn family he bequeathed his valuable library preserved at his country seat senton to the city of philadelphia smyth my being many years in the assembly the majority of which were constantly quakers gave me frequent opportunities of seeing the embarrassment given them by their principle against war whenever application was made to them by order of the crown to grant aids for military purposes they were unwilling to offend government on the one hand by a direct refusal and their friends the body of the quakers on the other by compliance contrary to their principles hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying and modes of disguising the compliance when it became unavoidable the common mode at last was to grant money under the phrase of its being for the king s use and never to inquire how it was applied but if the demand was not directly from the crown that phrase was found not so proper and some other was to be invented as when powder was wanting i think it was for the garrison at louisburg and the government of new england solicited a grant of some from pennsylvania which was much urg d on the house by governor thomas they could not grant money to buy powder because that was an ingredient of war but they voted an aid to new england of three thousand pounds to be put into the hands of the governor and appropriated it for the purchasing of bread flour wheat or other grain some of the council desirous of giving the house still further embarrassment advis d the governor not to accept provision as not being the thing he had demanded but he repli d i shall take the money for i understand very well their meaning other grain is gunpowder which he accordingly bought and they never objected to it see the votes marg note it was in allusion to this fact that when in our fire company we feared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery and i had said to my friend mr syng one of our members if we fail let us move the purchase of a fire engine with the money the quakers can have no objection to that and then if you nominate me and i you as a committee for that purpose we will buy a great gun which is certainly a fire engine i see says he you have improv d by being so long in the assembly your equivocal project would be just a match for their wheat or other grain these embarrassments that the quakers suffer d from having establish d and published it as one of their principles that no kind of war was lawful and which being once published they could not afterwards however they might change their minds easily get rid of reminds me of what i think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us that of the dunkers i was acquainted with one of its founders michael welfare soon after it appear d he complain d to me that they were grievously calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions and charg d with abominable principles and practices to which they were utter strangers i told him this had always been the case with new sects and that to put a stop to such abuse i imagin d it might be well to publish the articles of their belief and the rules of their discipline he said that it had been propos d among them but not agreed to for this reason when we were first drawn together as a society says he it had pleased god to enlighten our minds so far as to see that some doctrines which we once esteemed truths were errors and that others which we had esteemed errors were real truths from time to time he has been pleased to afford us farther light and our principles have been improving and our errors diminishing now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression and at the perfection of spiritual or theological knowledge and we fear that if we should once print our confession of faith we should feel ourselves as if bound and confin d by it and perhaps be unwilling to receive further improvement and our successors still more so as conceiving what we their elders and founders had done to be something sacred never to be departed from this modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history of mankind every other sect supposing itself in possession of all truth and that those who differ are so far in the wrong like a man traveling in foggy weather those at some distance before him on the road he sees wrapped up in the fog as well as those behind him and also the people in the fields on each side but near him all appears clear tho in truth he is as much in the fog as any of them to avoid this kind of embarrassment the quakers have of late years been gradually declining the public service in the assembly and in the magistracy choosing rather to quit their power than their principle in order of time i should have mentioned before that having in invented an open stove for the better warming of rooms and at the same time saving fuel as the fresh air admitted was warmed in entering i made a present of the model to mr robert grace one of my early friends who having an iron furnace found the casting of the plates for these stoves a profitable thing as they were growing in demand to promote that demand i wrote and published a pamphlet entitled an account of the new invented pennsylvania fireplaces wherein their construction and manner of operation is particularly explained their advantages above every other method of warming rooms demonstrated and all objections that have been raised against the use of them answered and obviated etc this pamphlet had a good effect gov r thomas was so pleas d with the construction of this stove as described in it that he offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them for a term of years but i declin d it from a principle which has ever weighed with me on such occasions viz that as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours and this we should do freely and generously the franklin stove is still in use warwick furnace chester county pennsylvania across the schuylkill river from pottstown an ironmonger in london however assuming a good deal of my pamphlet and working it up into his own and making some small changes in the machine which rather hurt its operation got a patent for it there and made as i was told a little fortune by it and this is not the only instance of patents taken out for my inventions by others tho not always with the same success which i never contested as having no desire of profiting by patents myself and hating disputes the use of these fireplaces in very many houses both of this and the neighbouring colonies has been and is a great saving of wood to the inhabitants xiii public services and duties peace being concluded and the association business therefore at an end i turn d my thoughts again to the affair of establishing an academy the first step i took was to associate in the design a number of active friends of whom the junto furnished a good part the next was to write and publish a pamphlet entitled proposals relating to the education of youth in pennsylvania this i distributed among the principal inhabitants gratis and as soon as i could suppose their minds a little prepared by the perusal of it i set on foot a subscription for opening and supporting an academy it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five years by so dividing it i judg d the subscription might be larger and i believe it was so amounting to no less if i remember right than five thousand pounds in the introduction to these proposals i stated their publication not as an act of mine but of some publick spirited gentlemen avoiding as much as i could according to my usual rule the presenting myself to the publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit the subscribers to carry the project into immediate execution chose out of their number twenty four trustees and appointed mr francis then attorney general and myself to draw up constitutions for the government of the academy which being done and signed a house was hired masters engag d and the schools opened i think in the same year tench francis uncle of sir philip francis emigrated from england to maryland and became attorney for lord baltimore he removed to philadelphia and was attorney general of pennsylvania from to he died in philadelphia august smyth the scholars increasing fast the house was soon found too small and we were looking out for a piece of ground properly situated with intention to build when providence threw into our way a large house ready built which with a few alterations might well serve our purpose this was the building before mentioned erected by the hearers of mr whitefield and was obtained for us in the following manner it is to be noted that the contributions to this building being made by people of different sects care was taken in the nomination of trustees in whom the building and ground was to be vested that a predominancy should not be given to any sect lest in time that predominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the use of such sect contrary to the original intention it was therefore that one of each sect was appointed viz one church of england man one presbyterian one baptist one moravian etc those in case of vacancy by death were to fill it by election from among the contributors the moravian happen d not to please his colleagues and on his death they resolved to have no other of that sect the difficulty then was how to avoid having two of some other sect by means of the new choice several persons were named and for that reason not agreed to at length one mention d me with the observation that i was merely an honest man and of no sect at all which prevailed with them to chuse me the enthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long since abat d and its trustees had not been able to procure fresh contributions for paying the ground rent and discharging some other debts the building had occasion d which embarrass d them greatly being now a member of both sets of trustees that for the building and that for the academy i had a good opportunity of negotiating with both and brought them finally to an agreement by which the trustees for the building were to cede it to those of the academy the latter undertaking to discharge the debt to keep forever open in the building a large hall for occasional preachers according to the original intention and maintain a free school for the instruction of poor children writings were accordingly drawn and on paying the debts the trustees of the academy were put in possession of the premises and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories and different rooms above and below for the several schools and purchasing some additional ground the whole was soon made fit for our purpose and the scholars remov d into the building the care and trouble of agreeing with the workmen purchasing materials and superintending the work fell upon me and i went thro it the more cheerfully as it did not then interfere with my private business having the year before taken a very able industrious and honest partner mr david hall with whose character i was well acquainted as he had work d for me four years he took off my hands all care of the printing office paying me punctually my share of the profits the partnership continued eighteen years successfully for us both the trustees of the academy after a while were incorporated by a charter from the governor their funds were increas d by contributions in britain and grants of land from the proprietaries to which the assembly has since made considerable addition and thus was established the present university of philadelphia i have been continued one of its trustees from the beginning now near forty years and have had the very great pleasure of seeing a number of the youth who have receiv d their education in it distinguish d by their improv d abilities serviceable in public stations and ornaments to their country later called the university of pennsylvania when i disengaged myself as above mentioned from private business i flatter d myself that by the sufficient tho moderate fortune i had acquir d i had secured leisure during the rest of my life for philosophical studies and amusements i purchased all dr spence s apparatus who had come from england to lecture here and i proceeded in my electrical experiments with great alacrity but the publick now considering me as a man of leisure laid hold of me for their purposes every part of our civil government and almost at the same time imposing some duty upon me the governor put me into the commission of the peace the corporation of the city chose me of the common council and soon after an alderman and the citizens at large chose me a burgess to represent them in assembly this latter station was the more agreeable to me as i was at length tired with sitting there to hear debates in which as clerk i could take no part and which were often so unentertaining that i was induc d to amuse myself with making magic squares or circles or anything to avoid weariness and i conceiv d my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doing good i would not however insinuate that my ambition was not flatter d by all these promotions it certainly was for considering my low beginning they were great things to me and they were still more pleasing as being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion and by me entirely unsolicited the office of justice of the peace i try d a little by attending a few courts and sitting on the bench to hear causes but finding that more knowledge of the common law than i possess d was necessary to act in that station with credit i gradually withdrew from it excusing myself by my being oblig d to attend the higher duties of a legislator in the assembly my election to this trust was repeated every year for ten years without my ever asking any elector for his vote or signifying either directly or indirectly any desire of being chosen on taking my seat in the house my son was appointed their clerk the year following a treaty being to be held with the indians at carlisle the governor sent a message to the house proposing that they should nominate some of their members to be join d with some members of council as commissioners for that purpose the house named the speaker mr norris and myself and being commission d we went to carlisle and met the indians accordingly see the votes to have this more correctly marg note as those people are extreamly apt to get drunk and when so are very quarrelsome and disorderly we strictly forbade the selling any liquor to them and when they complain d of this restriction we told them that if they would continue sober during the treaty we would give them plenty of rum when business was over they promis d this and they kept their promise because they could get no liquor and the treaty was conducted very orderly and concluded to mutual satisfaction they then claim d and received the rum this was in the afternoon they were near one hundred men women and children and were lodg d in temporary cabins built in the form of a square just without the town in the evening hearing a great noise among them the commissioners walk d out to see what was the matter we found they had made a great bonfire in the middle of the square they were all drunk men and women quarreling and fighting their dark colour d bodies half naked seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire running after and beating one another with firebrands accompanied by their horrid yellings form d a scene the most resembling our ideas of hell that could well be imagin d there was no appeasing the tumult and we retired to our lodging at midnight a number of them came thundering at our door demanding more rum of which we took no notice the next day sensible they had misbehav d in giving us that disturbance they sent three of their old counselors to make their apology the orator acknowledg d the fault but laid it upon the rum and then endeavoured to excuse the rum by saying the great spirit who made all things made everything for some use and whatever use he design d anything for that use it should always be put to now when he made rum he said let this be for the indians to get drunk with and it must be so and indeed if it be the design of providence to extirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the earth it seems not improbable that rum may be the appointed means it has already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the sea coast illustration in the evening hearing a great noise among them the commissioners walk d out to see what was the matter in dr thomas bond a particular friend of mine conceived the idea of establishing a hospital in philadelphia a very beneficent design which has been ascrib d to me but was originally his for the reception and cure of poor sick persons whether inhabitants of the province or strangers he was zealous and active in endeavouring to procure subscriptions for it but the proposal being a novelty in america and at first not well understood he met but with small success at length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was no such thing as carrying a public spirited project through without my being concern d in it for says he i am often ask d by those to whom i propose subscribing have you consulted franklin upon this business and what does he think of it and when i tell them that i have not supposing it rather out of your line they do not subscribe but say they will consider of it i enquired into the nature and probable utility of his scheme and receiving from him a very satisfactory explanation i not only subscrib d to it myself but engag d heartily in the design of procuring subscriptions from others previously however to the solicitation i endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers which was my usual custom in such cases but which he had omitted the subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous but beginning to flag i saw they would be insufficient without some assistance from the assembly and therefore propos d to petition for it which was done the country members did not at first relish the project they objected that it could only be serviceable to the city and therefore the citizens alone should be at the expense of it and they doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approv d of it my allegation on the contrary that it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of our being able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations they considered as a most extravagant supposition and utterly impossible on this i form d my plan and asking leave to bring in a bill for incorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their petition and granting them a blank sum of money which leave was obtained chiefly on the consideration that the house could throw the bill out if they did not like it i drew it so as to make the important clause a conditional one viz and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid that when the said contributors shall have met and chosen their managers and treasurer and shall have raised by their contributions a capital stock of value the yearly interest of which is to be applied to the accommodating of the sick poor in the said hospital free of charge for diet attendance advice and medicines and shall make the same appear to the satisfaction of the speaker of the assembly for the time being that then it shall and may be lawful for the said speaker and he is hereby required to sign an order on the provincial treasurer for the payment of two thousand pounds in two yearly payments to the treasurer of the said hospital to be applied to the founding building and finishing of the same this condition carried the bill through for the members who had oppos d the grant and now conceiv d they might have the credit of being charitable without the expense agreed to its passage and then in soliciting subscriptions among the people we urg d the conditional promise of the law as an additional motive to give since every man s donation would be doubled thus the clause work d both ways the subscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum and we claim d and receiv d the public gift which enabled us to carry the design into execution a convenient and handsome building was soon erected the institution has by constant experience been found useful and flourishes to this day and i do not remember any of my political manoeuvers the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure or wherein after thinking of it i more easily excus d myself for having made some use of cunning it was about this time that another projector the rev gilbert tennent came to me with a request that i would assist him in procuring a subscription for erecting a new meeting house it was to be for the use of a congregation he had gathered among the presbyterians who were originally disciples of mr whitefield unwilling to make myself disagreeable to my fellow citizens by too frequently soliciting their contributions i absolutely refus d he then desired i would furnish him with a list of the names of persons i knew by experience to be generous and public spirited i thought it would be unbecoming in me after their kind compliance with my solicitations to mark them out to be worried by other beggars and therefore refus d also to give such a list he then desir d i would at least give him my advice that i will readily do said i and in the first place i advise you to apply to all those whom you know will give something next to those whom you are uncertain whether they will give anything or not and show them the list of those who have given and lastly do not neglect those who you are sure will give nothing for in some of them you may be mistaken he laugh d and thank d me and said he would take my advice he did so for he ask d of everybody and he obtain d a much larger sum than he expected with which he erected the capacious and very elegant meeting house that stands in arch street gilbert tennent came to america with his father rev william tennent and taught for a time in the log college from which sprang the college of new jersey smyth our city tho laid out with a beautiful regularity the streets large straight and crossing each other at right angles had the disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpav d and in wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages plough d them into a quagmire so that it was difficult to cross them and in dry weather the dust was offensive i had liv d near what was call d the jersey market and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions a strip of ground down the middle of that market was at length pav d with brick so that being once in the market they had firm footing but were often over shoes in dirt to get there by talking and writing on the subject i was at length instrumental in getting the street pav d with stone between the market and the brick d foot pavement that was on each side next the houses this for some time gave an easy access to the market dry shod but the rest of the street not being pav d whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement it shook off and left its dirt upon it and it was soon cover d with mire which was not remov d the city as yet having no scavengers after some inquiry i found a poor industrious man who was willing to undertake keeping the pavement clean by sweeping it twice a week carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours doors for the sum of sixpence per month to be paid by each house i then wrote and printed a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that might be obtain d by this small expense the greater ease in keeping our houses clean so much dirt not being brought in by people s feet the benefit to the shops by more custom etc etc as buyers could more easily get at them and by not having in windy weather the dust blown in upon their goods etc etc i sent one of these papers to each house and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe an agreement to pay these sixpences it was unanimously sign d and for a time well executed all the inhabitants of the city were delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market it being a convenience to all and this rais d a general desire to have all the streets paved and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose after some time i drew a bill for paving the city and brought it into the assembly it was just before i went to england in and did not pass till i was gone and then with an alteration in the mode of assessment which i thought not for the better but with an additional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets which was a great improvement it was by a private person the late mr john clifton his giving a sample of the utility of lamps by placing one at his door that the people were first impress d with the idea of enlighting all the city the honour of this public benefit has also been ascrib d to me but it belongs truly to that gentleman i did but follow his example and have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps as differing from the globe lamps we were at first supply d with from london those we found inconvenient in these respects they admitted no air below the smoke therefore did not readily go out above but circulated in the globe lodg d on its inside and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford giving besides the daily trouble of wiping them clean and an accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it and render it totally useless i therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke and crevices admitting air below to facilitate the ascent of the smoke by this means they were kept clean and did not grow dark in a few hours as the london lamps do but continu d bright till morning and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane easily repair d i have sometimes wonder d that the londoners did not from the effect holes in the bottom of the globe lamps us d at vauxhall have in keeping them clean learn to have such holes in their street lamps but these holes being made for another purpose viz to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro them the other use of letting in air seems not to have been thought of and therefore after the lamps have been lit a few hours the streets of london are very poorly illuminated see votes vauxhall gardens once a popular and fashionable london resort situated on the thames above lambeth the gardens were closed in but they will always be remembered because of sir roger de coverley s visit to them in the spectator and from the descriptions in smollett s humphry clinker and thackeray s vanity fair the mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one i propos d when in london to dr fothergill who was among the best men i have known and a great promoter of useful projects i had observ d that the streets when dry were never swept and the light dust carried away but it was suffer d to accumulate till wet weather reduc d it to mud and then after lying some days so deep on the pavement that there was no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms it was with great labour rak d together and thrown up into carts open above the sides of which suffered some of the slush at every jolt on the pavement to shake out and fall sometimes to the annoyance of foot passengers the reason given for not sweeping the dusty streets was that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses illustration a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom an accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be done in a little time i found at my door in craven street one morning a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom she appeared very pale and feeble as just come out of a fit of sickness i ask d who employ d her to sweep there she said nobody but i am very poor and in distress and i sweeps before gentle folkses doors and hopes they will give me something i bid her sweep the whole street clean and i would give her a shilling this was at nine o clock at she came for the shilling from the slowness i saw at first in her working i could scarce believe that the work was done so soon and sent my servant to examine it who reported that the whole street was swept perfectly clean and all the dust plac d in the gutter which was in the middle and the next rain wash d it quite away so that the pavement and even the kennel were perfectly clean a short street near charing cross london i then judg d that if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in three hours a strong active man might have done it in half the time and here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in such a narrow street running down its middle instead of two one on each side near the footway for where all the rain that falls on a street runs from the sides and meets in the middle it forms there a current strong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with but when divided into two channels it is often too weak to cleanse either and only makes the mud it finds more fluid so that the wheels of carriages and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the foot pavement which is thereby rendered foul and slippery and sometimes splash it upon those who are walking my proposal communicated to the good doctor was as follows for the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets of london and westminster it is proposed that the several watchmen be contracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons and the mud rak d up at other times each in the several streets and lanes of his round that they be furnish d with brooms and other proper instruments for these purposes to be kept at their respective stands ready to furnish the poor people they may employ in the service that in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps at proper distances before the shops and windows of houses are usually opened when the scavengers with close covered carts shall also carry it all away that the mud when rak d up be not left in heaps to be spread abroad again by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses but that the scavengers be provided with bodies of carts not plac d high upon wheels but low upon sliders with lattice bottoms which being cover d with straw will retain the mud thrown into them and permit the water to drain from it whereby it will become much lighter water making the greatest part of its weight these bodies of carts to be plac d at convenient distances and the mud brought to them in wheelbarrows they remaining where plac d till the mud is drain d and then horses brought to draw them away i have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of this proposal on account of the narrowness of some streets and the difficulty of placing the draining sleds so as not to encumber too much the passage but i am still of opinion that the former requiring the dust to be swept up and carry d away before the shops are open is very practicable in the summer when the days are long for in walking thro the strand and fleet street one morning at seven o clock i observ d there was not one shop open tho it had been daylight and the sun up above three hours the inhabitants of london chusing voluntarily to live much by candle light and sleep by sunshine and yet often complain a little absurdly of the duty on candles and the high price of tallow some may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating but when they consider that tho dust blown into the eyes of a single person or into a single shop on a windy day is but of small importance yet the great number of the instances in a populous city and its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence perhaps they will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen as by little advantages that occur every day thus if you teach a poor young man to shave himself and keep his razor in order you may contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas the money may be soon spent the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it but in the other case he escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers and of their sometimes dirty fingers offensive breaths and dull razors he shaves when most convenient to him and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument with these sentiments i have hazarded the few preceding pages hoping they may afford hints which some time or other may be useful to a city i love having lived many years in it very happily and perhaps to some of our towns in america having been for some time employed by the postmaster general of america as his comptroller in regulating several offices and bringing the officers to account i was upon his death in appointed jointly with mr william hunter to succeed him by a commission from the postmaster general in england the american office never had hitherto paid anything to that of britain we were to have six hundred pounds a year between us if we could make that sum out of the profits of the office to do this a variety of improvements were necessary some of these were inevitably at first expensive so that in the first four years the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us but it soon after began to repay us and before i was displac d by a freak of the ministers of which i shall speak hereafter we had brought it to yield three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the post office of ireland since that imprudent transaction they have receiv d from it not one farthing the business of the post office occasion d my taking a journey this year to new england where the college of cambridge of their own motion presented me with the degree of master of arts yale college in connecticut had before made me a similar compliment thus without studying in any college i came to partake of their honours they were conferr d in consideration of my improvements and discoveries in the electric branch of natural philosophy xiv albany plan of union in war with france being again apprehended a congress of commissioners from the different colonies was by an order of the lords of trade to be assembled at albany there to confer with the chiefs of the six nations concerning the means of defending both their country and ours governor hamilton having receiv d this order acquainted the house with it requesting they would furnish proper presents for the indians to be given on this occasion and naming the speaker mr norris and myself to join mr thomas penn and mr secretary peters as commissioners to act for pennsylvania the house approv d the nomination and provided the goods for the present and tho they did not much like treating out of the provinces and we met the other commissioners at albany about the middle of june in our way thither i projected and drew a plan for the union of all the colonies under one government so far as might be necessary for defense and other important general purposes as we pass d thro new york i had there shown my project to mr james alexander and mr kennedy two gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs and being fortified by their approbation i ventur d to lay it before the congress it then appeared that several of the commissioners had form d plans of the same kind a previous question was first taken whether a union should be established which pass d in the affirmative unanimously a committee was then appointed one member from each colony to consider the several plans and report mine happen d to be preferr d and with a few amendments was accordingly reported illustration join or die by this plan the general government was to be administered by a president general appointed and supported by the crown and a grand council was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of the several colonies met in their respective assemblies the debates upon it in congress went on daily hand in hand with the indian business many objections and difficulties were started but at length they were all overcome and the plan was unanimously agreed to and copies ordered to be transmitted to the board of trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces its fate was singular the assemblies did not adopt it as they all thought there was too much prerogative in it and in england it was judg d to have too much of the democratic the board of trade therefore did not approve of it nor recommend it for the approbation of his majesty but another scheme was form d supposed to answer the same purpose better whereby the governors of the provinces with some members of their respective councils were to meet and order the raising of troops building of forts etc and to draw on the treasury of great britain for the expense which was afterwards to be refunded by an act of parliament laying a tax on america my plan with my reasons in support of it is to be found among my political papers that are printed being the winter following in boston i had much conversation with governor shirley upon both the plans part of what passed between us on the occasion may also be seen among those papers the different and contrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was really the true medium and i am still of opinion it would have been happy for both sides the water if it had been adopted the colonies so united would have been sufficiently strong to have defended themselves there would then have been no need of troops from england of course the subsequent pretence for taxing america and the bloody contest it occasioned would have been avoided but such mistakes are not new history is full of the errors of states and princes look round the habitable world how few know their own good or knowing it pursue those who govern having much business on their hands do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects the best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom but forc d by the occasion the governor of pennsylvania in sending it down to the assembly expressed his approbation of the plan as appearing to him to be drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment and therefore recommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious attention the house however by the management of a certain member took it up when i happen d to be absent which i thought not very fair and reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all to my no small mortification xv quarrels with the proprietary governors in my journey to boston this year i met at new york with our new governor mr morris just arriv d there from england with whom i had been before intimately acquainted he brought a commission to supersede mr hamilton who tir d with the disputes his proprietary instructions subjected him to had resign d mr morris ask d me if i thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration i said no you may on the contrary have a very comfortable one if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute with the assembly my dear friend says he pleasantly how can you advise my avoiding disputes you know i love disputing it is one of my greatest pleasures however to show the regard i have for your counsel i promise you i will if possible avoid them he had some reason for loving to dispute being eloquent an acute sophister and therefore generally successful in argumentative conversation he had been brought up to it from a boy his father as i have heard accustoming his children to dispute with one another for his diversion while sitting at table after dinner but i think the practice was not wise for in the course of my observation these disputing contradicting and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs they get victory sometimes but they never get good will which would be of more use to them we parted he going to philadelphia and i to boston in returning i met at new york with the votes of the assembly by which it appear d that notwithstanding his promise to me he and the house were already in high contention and it was a continual battle between them as long as he retain d the government i had my share of it for as soon as i got back to my seat in the assembly i was put on every committee for answering his speeches and messages and by the committees always desired to make the drafts our answers as well as his messages were often tart and sometimes indecently abusive and as he knew i wrote for the assembly one might have imagined that when we met we could hardly avoid cutting throats but he was so good natur d a man that no personal difference between him and me was occasion d by the contest and we often din d together illustration one afternoon in the height of this public quarrel we met in the street one afternoon in the height of this public quarrel we met in the street franklin says he you must go home with me and spend the evening i am to have some company that you will like and taking me by the arm he led me to his house in gay conversation over our wine after supper he told us jokingly that he much admir d the idea of sancho panza who when it was proposed to give him a government requested it might be a government of blacks as then if he could not agree with his people he might sell them one of his friends who sat next to me says franklin why do you continue to side with these damn d quakers had not you better sell them the proprietor would give you a good price the governor says i has not yet blacked them enough he indeed had laboured hard to blacken the assembly in all his messages but they wip d off his colouring as fast as he laid it on and plac d it in return thick upon his own face so that finding he was likely to be negrofied himself he as well as mr hamilton grew tir d of the contest and quitted the government these public quarrels were all at bottom owing to the proprietaries our hereditary governors who when any expense was to be incurred for the defense of their province with incredible meanness instructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary taxes unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly excused and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observe such instructions the assemblies for three years held out against this injustice tho constrained to bend at last at length captain denny who was governor morris s successor ventured to disobey those instructions how that was brought about i shall show hereafter the round selfish and self important squire of don quixote in cervantes romance of that name my acts in morris s time military etc marg note but i am got forward too fast with my story there are still some transactions to be mention d that happened during the administration of governor morris war being in a manner commenced with france the government of massachusetts bay projected an attack upon crown point and sent mr quincy to pennsylvania and mr pownall afterward governor pownall to new york to solicit assistance as i was in the assembly knew its temper and was mr quincy s countryman he appli d to me for my influence and assistance i dictated his address to them which was well received they voted an aid of ten thousand pounds to be laid out in provisions but the governor refusing his assent to their bill which included this with other sums granted for the use of the crown unless a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate from bearing any part of the tax that would be necessary the assembly tho very desirous of making their grant to new england effectual were at a loss how to accomplish it mr quincy labored hard with the governor to obtain his assent but he was obstinate on lake champlain ninety miles north of albany it was captured by the french in attacked by the english in and and abandoned by the french in it was finally captured from the english by the americans in i then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor by orders on the trustees of the loan office which by law the assembly had the right of drawing there was indeed little or no money at that time in the office and therefore i propos d that the orders should be payable in a year and to bear an interest of five per cent with these orders i suppos d the provisions might easily be purchas d the assembly with very little hesitation adopted the proposal the orders were immediately printed and i was one of the committee directed to sign and dispose of them the fund for paying them was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the province upon loan together with the revenue arising from the excise which being known to be more than sufficient they obtain d instant credit and were not only receiv d in payment for the provisions but many money d people who had cash lying by them vested it in those orders which they found advantageous as they bore interest while upon hand and might on any occasion be used as money so that they were eagerly all bought up and in a few weeks none of them were to be seen thus this important affair was by my means completed mr quincy return d thanks to the assembly in a handsome memorial went home highly pleas d with this success of his embassy and ever after bore for me the most cordial and affectionate friendship xvi braddock s expedition the british government not chusing to permit the union of the colonies as propos d at albany and to trust that union with their defense lest they should thereby grow too military and feel their own strength suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain d of them sent over general braddock with two regiments of regular english troops for that purpose he landed at alexandria in virginia and thence march d to frederictown in maryland where he halted for carriages our assembly apprehending from some information that he had conceived violent prejudices against them as averse to the service wish d me to wait upon him not as from them but as postmaster general under the guise of proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors of the several provinces with whom he must necessarily have continual correspondence and of which they propos d to pay the expense my son accompanied me on this journey we found the general at frederictown waiting impatiently for the return of those he had sent thro the back parts of maryland and virginia to collect waggons i stayed with him several days din d with him daily and had full opportunity of removing all his prejudices by the information of what the assembly had before his arrival actually done and were still willing to do to facilitate his operations when i was about to depart the returns of waggons to be obtained were brought in by which it appear d that they amounted only to twenty five and not all of those were in serviceable condition the general and all the officers were surpris d declar d the expedition was then at an end being impossible and exclaim d against the ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute of the means of conveying their stores baggage etc not less than one hundred and fifty waggons being necessary i happen d to say i thought it was pity they had not been landed rather in pennsylvania as in that country almost every farmer had his waggon the general eagerly laid hold of my words and said then you sir who are a man of interest there can probably procure them for us and i beg you will undertake it i ask d what terms were to be offer d the owners of the waggons and i was desir d to put on paper the terms that appeared to me necessary this i did and they were agreed to and a commission and instructions accordingly prepar d immediately what those terms were will appear in the advertisement i publish d as soon as i arriv d at lancaster which being from the great and sudden effect it produc d a piece of some curiosity i shall insert it at length as follows advertisement lancaster april whereas one hundred and fifty waggons with four horses to each waggon and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses are wanted for the service of his majesty s forces now about to rendezvous at will s creek and his excellency general braddock having been pleased to empower me to contract for the hire of the same i hereby give notice that i shall attend for that purpose at lancaster from this day to next wednesday evening and at york from next thursday morning till friday evening where i shall be ready to agree for waggons and teams or single horses on the following terms viz that there shall be paid for each waggon with four good horses and a driver fifteen shillings per diem and for each able horse with a pack saddle or other saddle and furniture two shillings per diem and for each able horse without a saddle eighteen pence per diem that the pay commence from the time of their joining the forces at will s creek which must be on or before the th of may ensuing and that a reasonable allowance be paid over and above for the time necessary for their travelling to will s creek and home again after their discharge each waggon and team and every saddle or pack horse is to be valued by indifferent persons chosen between me and the owner and in case of the loss of any waggon team or other horse in the service the price according to such valuation is to be allowed and paid seven days pay is to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the owner of each waggon and team or horse at the time of contracting if required and the remainder to be paid by general braddock or by the paymaster of the army at the time of their discharge or from time to time as it shall be demanded no drivers of waggons or persons taking care of the hired horses are on any account to be called upon to do the duty of soldiers or be otherwise employed than in conducting or taking care of their carriages or horses all oats indian corn or other forage that waggons or horses bring to the camp more than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses is to be taken for the use of the army and a reasonable price paid for the same note my son william franklin is empowered to enter into like contracts with any person in cumberland county b franklin to the inhabitants of the counties of lancaster york and cumberland friends and countrymen being occasionally at the camp at frederic a few days since i found the general and officers extremely exasperated on account of their not being supplied with horses and carriages which had been expected from this province as most able to furnish them but through the dissensions between our governor and assembly money had not been provided nor any steps taken for that purpose by chance it was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted and compel as many persons into the service as would be necessary to drive and take care of them i apprehended that the progress of british soldiers through these counties on such an occasion especially considering the temper they are in and their resentment against us would be attended with many and great inconveniences to the inhabitants and therefore more willingly took the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair and equitable means the people of these back counties have lately complained to the assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting you have an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very considerable sum for if the service of this expedition should continue as it is more than probable it will for one hundred and twenty days the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to upward of thirty thousand pounds which will be paid you in silver and gold of the king s money the service will be light and easy for the army will scarce march above twelve miles per day and the waggons and baggage horses as they carry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare of the army must march with the army and no faster and are for the army s sake always placed where they can be most secure whether in a march or in a camp if you are really as i believe you are good and loyal subjects to his majesty you may now do a most acceptable service and make it easy to yourselves for three or four of such as cannot separately spare from the business of their plantations a waggon and four horses and a driver may do it together one furnishing the waggon another one or two horses and another the driver and divide the pay proportionately between you but if you do not this service to your king and country voluntarily when such good pay and reasonable terms are offered to you your loyalty will be strongly suspected the king s business must be done so many brave troops come so far for your defense must not stand idle through your backwardness to do what may be reasonably expected from you waggons and horses must be had violent measures will probably be used and you will be left to seek for a recompense where you can find it and your case perhaps be little pitied or regarded i have no particular interest in this affair as except the satisfaction of endeavouring to do good i shall have only my labour for my pains if this method of obtaining the waggons and horses is not likely to succeed i am obliged to send word to the general in fourteen days and i suppose sir john st clair the hussar with a body of soldiers will immediately enter the province for the purpose which i shall be sorry to hear because i am very sincerely and truly your friend and well wisher b franklin i received of the general about eight hundred pounds to be disbursed in advance money to the waggon owners etc but that sum being insufficient i advanc d upward of two hundred pounds more and in two weeks the one hundred and fifty waggons with two hundred and fifty nine carrying horses were on their march for the camp the advertisement promised payment according to the valuation in case any waggon or horse should be lost the owners however alleging they did not know general braddock or what dependence might be had on his promise insisted on my bond for the performance which i accordingly gave them while i was at the camp supping one evening with the officers of colonel dunbar s regiment he represented to me his concern for the subalterns who he said were generally not in affluence and could ill afford in this dear country to lay in the stores that might be necessary in so long a march thro a wilderness where nothing was to be purchas d i commiserated their case and resolved to endeavour procuring them some relief i said nothing however to him of my intention but wrote the next morning to the committee of the assembly who had the disposition of some public money warmly recommending the case of these officers to their consideration and proposing that a present should be sent them of necessaries and refreshments my son who had some experience of a camp life and of its wants drew up a list for me which i enclos d in my letter the committee approv d and used such diligence that conducted by my son the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons they consisted of twenty parcels each containing lbs loaf sugar lbs good muscovado do lb good green tea lb good bohea do lbs good ground coffee lbs chocolate cwt best white biscuit lb pepper quart best white wine vinegar gloucester cheese kegg containing lbs good butter doz old madeira wine gallons jamaica spirits bottle flour of mustard well cur d hams dozen dry d tongues lbs rice lbs raisins these twenty parcels well pack d were placed on as many horses each parcel with the horse being intended as a present for one officer they were very thankfully receiv d and the kindness acknowledg d by letters to me from the colonels of both regiments in the most grateful terms the general too was highly satisfied with my conduct in procuring him the waggons etc and readily paid my account of disbursements thanking me repeatedly and requesting my farther assistance in sending provisions after him i undertook this also and was busily employ d in it till we heard of his defeat advancing for the service of my own money upwards of one thousand pounds sterling of which i sent him an account it came to his hands luckily for me a few days before the battle and he return d me immediately an order on the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds leaving the remainder to the next account i consider this payment as good luck having never been able to obtain that remainder of which more hereafter this general was i think a brave man and might probably have made a figure as a good officer in some european war but he had too much self confidence too high an opinion of the validity of regular troops and too mean a one of both americans and indians george croghan our indian interpreter join d him on his march with one hundred of those people who might have been of great use to his army as guides scouts etc if he had treated them kindly but he slighted and neglected them and they gradually left him in conversation with him one day he was giving me some account of his intended progress after taking fort duquesne says he i am to proceed to niagara and having taken that to frontenac if the season will allow time and i suppose it will for duquesne can hardly detain me above three or four days and then i see nothing that can obstruct my march to niagara having before revolv d in my mind the long line his army must make in their march by a very narrow road to be cut for them thro the woods and bushes and also what i had read of a former defeat of fifteen hundred french who invaded the iroquois country i had conceiv d some doubts and some fears for the event of the campaign but i ventur d only to say to be sure sir if you arrive well before duquesne with these fine troops so well provided with artillery that place not yet completely fortified and as we hear with no very strong garrison can probably make but a short resistance the only danger i apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of indians who by constant practice are dexterous in laying and executing them and the slender line near four miles long which your army must make may expose it to be attack d by surprise in its flanks and to be cut like a thread into several pieces which from their distance cannot come up in time to support each other pittsburg kingston at the eastern end of lake ontario he smil d at my ignorance and reply d these savages may indeed be a formidable enemy to your raw american militia but upon the king s regular and disciplin d troops sir it is impossible they should make any impression i was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with a military man in matters of his profession and said no more the enemy however did not take the advantage of his army which i apprehended its long line of march expos d it to but let it advance without interruption till within nine miles of the place and then when more in a body for it had just passed a river where the front had halted till all were come over and in a more open part of the woods than any it had pass d attack d its advanced guard by heavy fire from behind trees and bushes which was the first intelligence the general had of an enemy s being near him this guard being disordered the general hurried the troops up to their assistance which was done in great confusion thro waggons baggage and cattle and presently the fire came upon their flank the officers being on horseback were more easily distinguish d pick d out as marks and fell very fast and the soldiers were crowded together in a huddle having or hearing no orders and standing to be shot at till two thirds of them were killed and then being seiz d with a panick the whole fled with precipitation illustration the only danger i apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of indians the waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamper d their example was immediately followed by others so that all the waggons provisions artillery and stores were left to the enemy the general being wounded was brought off with difficulty his secretary mr shirley was killed by his side and out of eighty six officers sixty three were killed or wounded and seven hundred and fourteen men killed out of eleven hundred these eleven hundred had been picked men from the whole army the rest had been left behind with colonel dunbar who was to follow with the heavier part of the stores provisions and baggage the flyers not being pursu d arriv d at dunbar s camp and the panick they brought with them instantly seiz d him and all his people and tho he had now above one thousand men and the enemy who had beaten braddock did not at most exceed four hundred indians and french together instead of proceeding and endeavouring to recover some of the lost honour he ordered all the stores ammunition etc to be destroy d that he might have more horses to assist his flight towards the settlements and less lumber to remove he was there met with requests from the governors of virginia maryland and pennsylvania that he would post his troops on the frontier so as to afford some protection to the inhabitants but he continued his hasty march thro all the country not thinking himself safe till he arrived at philadelphia where the inhabitants could protect him this whole transaction gave us americans the first suspicion that our exalted ideas of the prowess of british regulars had not been well founded other accounts of this expedition and defeat may be found in fiske s washington and his country or lodge s george washington vol in their first march too from their landing till they got beyond the settlements they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants totally ruining some poor families besides insulting abusing and confining the people if they remonstrated this was enough to put us out of conceit of such defenders if we had really wanted any how different was the conduct of our french friends in who during a march thro the most inhabited part of our country from rhode island to virginia near seven hundred miles occasioned not the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig a chicken or even an apple captain orme who was one of the general s aids de camp and being grievously wounded was brought off with him and continu d with him to his death which happen d in a few days told me that he was totally silent all the first day and at night only said who would have thought it that he was silent again the following day saying only at last we shall better know how to deal with them another time and dy d in a few minutes after the secretary s papers with all the general s orders instructions and correspondence falling into the enemy s hands they selected and translated into french a number of the articles which they printed to prove the hostile intentions of the british court before the declaration of war among these i saw some letters of the general to the ministry speaking highly of the great service i had rendered the army and recommending me to their notice david hume too who was some years after secretary to lord hertford when minister in france and afterward to general conway when secretary of state told me he had seen among the papers in that office letters from braddock highly recommending me but the expedition having been unfortunate my service it seems was not thought of much value for those recommendations were never of any use to me a famous scotch philosopher and historian as to rewards from himself i ask d only one which was that he would give orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought servants and that he would discharge such as had been already enlisted this he readily granted and several were accordingly return d to their masters on my application dunbar when the command devolv d on him was not so generous he being at philadelphia on his retreat or rather flight i apply d to him for the discharge of the servants of three poor farmers of lancaster county that he had enlisted reminding him of the late general s orders on that head he promised me that if the masters would come to him at trenton where he should be in a few days on his march to new york he would there deliver their men to them they accordingly were at the expense and trouble of going to trenton and there he refus d to perform his promise to their great loss and disappointment as soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known all the owners came upon me for the valuation which i had given bond to pay their demands gave me a great deal of trouble my acquainting them that the money was ready in the paymaster s hands but that orders for paying it must first be obtained from general shirley and my assuring them that i had apply d to that general by letter but he being at a distance an answer could not soon be receiv d and they must have patience all this was not sufficient to satisfy and some began to sue me general shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims and ordering payment they amounted to near twenty thousand pound which to pay would have ruined me governor of massachusetts and commander of the british forces in america before we had the news of this defeat the two doctors bond came to me with a subscription paper for raising money to defray the expense of a grand firework which it was intended to exhibit at a rejoicing on receipt of the news of our taking fort duquesne i looked grave and said it would i thought be time enough to prepare for the rejoicing when we knew we should have occasion to rejoice they seem d surpris d that i did not immediately comply with their proposal why the d l says one of them you surely don t suppose that the fort will not be taken i don t know that it will not be taken but i know that the events of war are subject to great uncertainty i gave them the reasons of my doubting the subscription was dropt and the projectors thereby missed the mortification they would have undergone if the firework had been prepared dr bond on some other occasion afterward said that he did not like franklin s forebodings governor morris who had continually worried the assembly with message after message before the defeat of braddock to beat them into the making of acts to raise money for the defense of the province without taxing among others the proprietary estates and had rejected all their bills for not having such an exempting clause now redoubled his attacks with more hope of success the danger and necessity being greater the assembly however continu d firm believing they had justice on their side and that it would be giving up an essential right if they suffered the governor to amend their money bills in one of the last indeed which was for granting fifty thousand pounds his propos d amendment was only of a single word the bill express d that all estates real and personal were to be taxed those of the proprietaries not excepted his amendment was for not read only a small but very material alteration however when the news of this disaster reached england our friends there whom we had taken care to furnish with all the assembly s answers to the governor s messages rais d a clamor against the proprietaries for their meanness and injustice in giving their governor such instructions some going so far as to say that by obstructing the defense of their province they forfeited their right to it they were intimidated by this and sent orders to their receiver general to add five thousand pounds of their money to whatever sum might be given by the assembly for such purpose this being notified to the house was accepted in lieu of their share of a general tax and a new bill was form d with an exempting clause which passed accordingly by this act i was appointed one of the commissioners for disposing of the money sixty thousand pounds i had been active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage and had at the same time drawn a bill for establishing and disciplining a voluntary militia which i carried thro the house without much difficulty as care was taken in it to leave the quakers at their liberty to promote the association necessary to form the militia i wrote a dialogue stating and answering all the objections i could think of to such a militia which was printed and had as i thought great effect this dialogue and the militia act are in the gentleman s magazine for february and march marg note xvii franklin s defense of the frontier while the several companies in the city and country were forming and learning their exercise the governor prevail d with me to take charge of our north western frontier which was infested by the enemy and provide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops and building a line of forts i undertook this military business tho i did not conceive myself well qualified for it he gave me a commission with full powers and a parcel of blank commissions for officers to be given to whom i thought fit i had but little difficulty in raising men having soon five hundred and sixty under my command my son who had in the preceding war been an officer in the army rais d against canada was my aid de camp and of great use to me the indians had burned gnadenhut a village settled by the moravians and massacred the inhabitants but the place was thought a good situation for one of the forts pronounced gna den hoot in order to march thither i assembled the companies at bethlehem the chief establishment of those people i was surprised to find it in so good a posture of defense the destruction of gnadenhut had made them apprehend danger the principal buildings were defended by a stockade they had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from new york and had even plac d quantities of small paving stones between the windows of their high stone houses for their women to throw down upon the heads of any indians that should attempt to force into them the armed brethren too kept watch and reliev d as methodically as in any garrison town in conversation with the bishop spangenberg i mention d this my surprise for knowing they had obtained an act of parliament exempting them from military duties in the colonies i had suppos d they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms he answer d me that it was not one of their established principles but that at the time of their obtaining that act it was thought to be a principle with many of their people on this occasion however they to their surprise found it adopted by but a few it seems they were either deceiv d in themselves or deceiv d the parliament but common sense aided by present danger will sometimes be too strong for whimsical opinions it was the beginning of january when we set out upon this business of building forts i sent one detachment toward the minisink with instructions to erect one for the security of that upper part of the country and another to the lower part with similar instructions and i concluded to go myself with the rest of my force to gnadenhut where a fort was tho t more immediately necessary the moravians procur d me five waggons for our tools stores baggage etc just before we left bethlehem eleven farmers who had been driven from their plantations by the indians came to me requesting a supply of firearms that they might go back and fetch off their cattle i gave them each a gun with suitable ammunition we had not march d many miles before it began to rain and it continued raining all day there were no habitations on the road to shelter us till we arriv d near night at the house of a german where and in his barn we were all huddled together as wet as water could make us it was well we were not attack d in our march for our arms were of the most ordinary sort and our men could not keep their gun locks dry the indians are dexterous in contrivances for that purpose which we had not they met that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned and killed ten of them the one who escap d inform d that his and his companions guns would not go off the priming being wet with the rain flint lock guns discharged by means of a spark struck from flint and steel into powder priming in an open pan illustration we had not march d many miles before it began to rain the next day being fair we continu d our march and arriv d at the desolated gnadenhut there was a saw mill near round which were left several piles of boards with which we soon hutted ourselves an operation the more necessary at that inclement season as we had no tents our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found there who had been half interr d by the country people the next morning our fort was plann d and mark d out the circumference measuring four hundred and fifty five feet which would require as many palisades to be made of trees one with another of a foot diameter each our axes of which we had seventy were immediately set to work to cut down trees and our men being dexterous in the use of them great despatch was made seeing the trees fall so fast i had the curiosity to look at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine in six minutes they had it upon the ground and i found it of fourteen inches diameter each pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long pointed at one end while these were preparing our other men dug a trench all round of three feet deep in which the palisades were to be planted and our waggons the bodies being taken off and the fore and hind wheels separated by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch we had ten carriages with two horses each to bring the palisades from the woods to the spot when they were set up our carpenters built a stage illustration our axes were immediately set to work to cut down trees of boards all round within about six feet high for the men to stand on when to fire thro the loopholes we had one swivel gun which we mounted on one of the angles and fir d it as soon as fix d to let the indians know if any were within hearing that we had such pieces and thus our fort if such a magnificent name may be given to so miserable a stockade was finish d in a week though it rain d so hard every other day that the men could not work here the pole connecting the front and rear wheels of a wagon this gave me occasion to observe that when men are employ d they are best content d for on the days they worked they were good natur d and cheerful and with the consciousness of having done a good day s work they spent the evening jollily but on our idle days they were mutinous and quarrelsome finding fault with their pork the bread etc and in continual ill humour which put me in mind of a sea captain whose rule it was to keep his men constantly at work and when his mate once told him that they had done everything and there was nothing further to employ them about oh says he make them scour the anchor this kind of fort however contemptible is a sufficient defense against indians who have no cannon finding ourselves now posted securely and having a place to retreat to on occasion we ventur d out in parties to scour the adjacent country we met with no indians but we found the places on the neighbouring hills where they had lain to watch our proceedings there was an art in their contrivance of those places that seems worth mention it being winter a fire was necessary for them but a common fire on the surface of the ground would by its light have discover d their position at a distance they had therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter and somewhat deeper we saw where they had with their hatchets cut off the charcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods with these coals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes and we observ d among the weeds and grass the prints of their bodies made by their laying all round with their legs hanging down in the holes to keep their feet warm which with them is an essential point this kind of fire so manag d could not discover them either by its light flame sparks or even smoke it appear d that their number was not great and it seems they saw we were too many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage we had for our chaplain a zealous presbyterian minister mr beatty who complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers and exhortations when they enlisted they were promised besides pay and provisions a gill of rum a day which was punctually serv d out to them half in the morning and the other half in the evening and i observed they were as punctual in attending to receive it upon which i said to mr beatty it is perhaps below the dignity of your profession to act as steward of the rum but if you were to deal it out and only just after prayers you would have them all about you he liked the tho t undertook the office and with the help of a few hands to measure out the liquor executed it to satisfaction and never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended so that i thought this method preferable to the punishment inflicted by some military laws for non attendance on divine service i had hardly finish d this business and got my fort well stor d with provisions when i receiv d a letter from the governor acquainting me that he had call d the assembly and wished my attendance there if the posture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remaining there was no longer necessary my friends too of the assembly pressing me by their letters to be if possible at the meeting and my three intended forts being now compleated and the inhabitants contented to remain on their farms under that protection i resolved to return the more willingly as a new england officer colonel clapham experienced in indian war being on a visit to our establishment consented to accept the command i gave him a commission and parading the garrison had it read before them and introduc d him to them as an officer who from his skill in military affairs was much more fit to command them than myself and giving them a little exhortation took my leave i was escorted as far as bethlehem where i rested a few days to recover from the fatigue i had undergone the first night being in a good bed i could hardly sleep it was so different from my hard lodging on the floor of our hut at gnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two while at bethlehem i inquir d a little into the practice of the moravians some of them had accompanied me and all were very kind to me i found they work d for a common stock ate at common tables and slept in common dormitories great numbers together in the dormitories i observed loopholes at certain distances all along just under the ceiling which i thought judiciously placed for change of air i was at their church where i was entertain d with good musick the organ being accompanied with violins hautboys flutes clarinets etc i understood that their sermons were not usually preached to mixed congregations of men women and children as is our common practice but that they assembled sometimes the married men at other times their wives then the young men the young women and the little children each division by itself the sermon i heard was to the latter who came in and were plac d in rows on benches the boys under the conduct of a young man their tutor and the girls conducted by a young woman the discourse seem d well adapted to their capacities and was delivered in a pleasing familiar manner coaxing them as it were to be good they behav d very orderly but looked pale and unhealthy which made me suspect they were kept too much within doors or not allow d sufficient exercise i inquir d concerning the moravian marriages whether the report was true that they were by lot i was told that lots were us d only in particular cases that generally when a young man found himself dispos d to marry he inform d the elders of his class who consulted the elder ladies that govern d the young women as these elders of the different sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions of their respective pupils they could best judge what matches were suitable and their judgments were generally acquiesc d in but if for example it should happen that two or three young women were found to be equally proper for the young man the lot was then recurred to i objected if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the parties some of them may chance to be very unhappy and so they may answer d my informer if you let the parties chuse for themselves which indeed i could not deny being returned to philadelphia i found the association went on swimmingly the inhabitants that were not quakers having pretty generally come into it formed themselves into companies and chose their captains lieutenants and ensigns according to the new law dr b visited me and gave me an account of the pains he had taken to spread a general good liking to the law and ascribed much to those endeavours i had had the vanity to ascribe all to my dialogue however not knowing but that he might be in the right i let him enjoy his opinion which i take to be generally the best way in such cases the officers meeting chose me to be colonel of the regiment which i this time accepted i forget how many companies we had but we paraded about twelve hundred well looking men with a company of artillery who had been furnished with six brass field pieces which they had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve times in a minute the first time i reviewed my regiment they accompanied me to my house and would salute me with some rounds fired before my door which shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus and my new honour proved not much less brittle for all our commissions were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in england during this short time of my colonelship being about to set out on a journey to virginia the officers of my regiment took it into their heads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town as far as the lower ferry just as i was getting on horseback they came to my door between thirty and forty mounted and all in their uniforms i had not been previously acquainted with the project or i should have prevented it being naturally averse to the assuming of state on any occasion and i was a good deal chagrin d at their appearance as i could not avoid their accompanying me what made it worse was that as soon as we began to move they drew their swords and rode with them naked all the way somebody wrote an account of this to the proprietor and it gave him great offense no such honour had been paid him when in the province nor to any of his governors and he said it was only proper to princes of the blood royal which may be true for aught i know who was and still am ignorant of the etiquette in such cases this silly affair however greatly increased his rancour against me which was before not a little on account of my conduct in the assembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation which i had always oppos d very warmly and not without severe reflections on his meanness and injustice of contending for it he accused me to the ministry as being the great obstacle to the king s service preventing by my influence in the house the proper form of the bills for raising money and he instanced this parade with my officers as a proof of my having an intention to take the government of the province out of his hands by force he also applied to sir everard fawkener the postmaster general to deprive me of my office but it had no other effect than to procure from sir everard a gentle admonition notwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and the house in which i as a member had so large a share there still subsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman and myself and we never had any personal difference i have sometimes since thought that his little or no resentment against me for the answers it was known i drew up to his messages might be the effect of professional habit and that being bred a lawyer he might consider us both as merely advocates for contending clients in a suit he for the proprietaries and i for the assembly he would therefore sometimes call in a friendly way to advise with me on difficult points and sometimes tho not often take my advice we acted in concert to supply braddock s army with provisions and when the shocking news arrived of his defeat the governor sent in haste for me to consult with him on measures for preventing the desertion of the back counties i forget now the advice i gave but i think it was that dunbar should be written to and prevail d with if possible to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection till by reinforcements from the colonies he might be able to proceed on the expedition and after my return from the frontier he would have had me undertake the conduct of such an expedition with provincial troops for the reduction of fort duquesne dunbar and his men being otherwise employed and he proposed to commission me as general i had not so good an opinion of my military abilities as he profess d to have and i believe his professions must have exceeded his real sentiments but probably he might think that my popularity would facilitate the raising of the men and my influence in assembly the grant of money to pay them and that perhaps without taxing the proprietary estate finding me not so forward to engage as he expected the project was dropt and he soon after left the government being superseded by captain denny xviii scientific experiments before i proceed in relating the part i had in public affairs under this new governor s administration it may not be amiss here to give some account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation in being at boston i met there with a dr spence who was lately arrived from scotland and show d me some electric experiments they were imperfectly perform d as he was not very expert but being on a subject quite new to me they equally surpris d and pleased me soon after my return to philadelphia our library company receiv d from mr p collinson fellow of the royal society of london a present of a glass tube with some account of the use of it in making such experiments i eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what i had seen at boston and by much practice acquired great readiness in performing those also which we had an account of from england adding a number of new ones i say much practice for my house was continually full for some time with people who came to see these new wonders the royal society of london for improving natural knowledge was founded in and holds the foremost place among english societies for the advancement of science to divide a little this incumbrance among my friends i caused a number of similar tubes to be blown at our glass house with which they furnish d themselves so that we had at length several performers among these the principal was mr kinnersley an ingenious neighbour who being out of business i encouraged to undertake showing the experiments for money and drew up for him two lectures in which the experiments were rang d in such order and accompanied with such explanations in such method as that the foregoing should assist in comprehending the following he procur d an elegant apparatus for the purpose in which all the little machines that i had roughly made for myself were nicely form d by instrument makers his lectures were well attended and gave great satisfaction and after some time he went thro the colonies exhibiting them in every capital town and pick d up some money in the west india islands indeed it was with difficulty the experiments could be made from the general moisture of the air oblig d as we were to mr collinson for his present of the tube etc i thought it right he should be inform d of our success in using it and wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments he got them read in the royal society where they were not at first thought worth so much notice as to be printed in their transactions one paper which i wrote for mr kinnersley on the sameness of lightning with electricity i sent to dr mitchel an acquaintance of mine and one of the members also of that society who wrote me word that it had been read but was laughed at by the connoisseurs the papers however being shown to dr fothergill he thought them of too much value to be stifled and advis d the printing of them mr collinson then gave them to cave for publication in his gentleman s magazine but he chose to print them separately in a pamphlet and dr fothergill wrote the preface cave it seems judged rightly for his profit for by the additions that arrived afterward they swell d to a quarto volume which has had five editions and cost him nothing for copy money see page it was however some time before those papers were much taken notice of in england a copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the count de buffon a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in france and indeed all over europe he prevailed with m dalibard to translate them into french and they were printed at paris the publication offended the abbe nollet preceptor in natural philosophy to the royal family and an able experimenter who had form d and publish d a theory of electricity which then had the general vogue he could not at first believe that such a work came from america and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at paris to decry his system afterwards having been assur d that there really existed such a person as franklin at philadelphia which he had doubted he wrote and published a volume of letters chiefly address d to me defending his theory and denying the verity of my experiments and of the positions deduc d from them a celebrated french naturalist dalibard who had translated franklin s letters to collinson into french was the first to demonstrate in a practical application of franklin s experiment that lightning and electricity are the same this was may th one month before franklin flew his famous kite at philadelphia and proved the fact himself mcmaster i once purpos d answering the abbe and actually began the answer but on consideration that my writings contained a description of experiments which anyone might repeat and verify and if not to be verifi d could not be defended or of observations offer d as conjectures and not delivered dogmatically therefore not laying me under any obligation to defend them and reflecting that a dispute between two persons writing in different languages might be lengthened greatly by mistranslations and thence misconceptions of one another s meaning much of one of the abbe s letters being founded on an error in the translation i concluded to let my papers shift for themselves believing it was better to spend what time i could spare from public business in making new experiments than in disputing about those already made i therefore never answered m nollet and the event gave me no cause to repent my silence for my friend m le roy of the royal academy of sciences took up my cause and refuted him my book was translated into the italian german and latin languages and the doctrine it contain d was by degrees universally adopted by the philosophers of europe in preference to that of the abbe so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect except monsieur b of paris his eleve and immediate disciple what gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity was the success of one of its proposed experiments made by messrs dalibard and de lor at marly for drawing lightning from the clouds this engag d the public attention everywhere m de lor who had an apparatus for experimental philosophy and lectur d in that branch of science undertook to repeat what he called the philadelphia experiments and after they were performed before the king and court all the curious of paris flocked to see them i will not swell this narrative with an account of that capital experiment nor of the infinite pleasure i receiv d in the success of a similar one i made soon after with a kite at philadelphia as both are to be found in the histories of electricity dr wright an english physician when at paris wrote to a friend who was of the royal society an account of the high esteem my experiments were in among the learned abroad and of their wonder that my writings had been so little noticed in england the society on this resum d the consideration of the letters that had been read to them and the celebrated dr watson drew up a summary account of them and of all i had afterwards sent to england on the subject which he accompanied with some praise of the writer this summary was then printed in their transactions and some members of the society in london particularly the very ingenious mr canton having verified the experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed rod and acquainting them with the success they soon made me more than amends for the slight with which they had before treated me without my having made any application for that honour they chose me a member and voted that i should be excus d the customary payments which would have amounted to twenty five guineas and ever since have given me their transactions gratis they also presented me with the gold medal of sir godfrey copley for the year the delivery of which was accompanied by a very handsome speech of the president lord macclesfield wherein i was highly honoured an english baronet died in donator of a fund of in trust for the royal society of london for improving natural knowledge illustration gold medal of sir godfrey copley xix agent of pennsylvania in london our new governor captain denny brought over for me the before mentioned medal from the royal society which he presented to me at an entertainment given him by the city he accompanied it with very polite expressions of his esteem for me having as he said been long acquainted with my character after dinner when the company as was customary at that time were engag d in drinking he took me aside into another room and acquainted me that he had been advis d by his friends in england to cultivate a friendship with me as one who was capable of giving him the best advice and of contributing most effectually to the making his administration easy that he therefore desired of all things to have a good understanding with me and he begged me to be assured of his readiness on all occasions to render me every service that might be in his power he said much to me also of the proprietor s good disposition towards the province and of the advantage it might be to us all and to me in particular if the opposition that had been so long continu d to his measures was dropt and harmony restor d between him and the people in effecting which it was thought no one could be more serviceable than myself and i might depend on adequate acknowledgments and recompenses etc etc the drinkers finding we did not return immediately to the table sent us a decanter of madeira which the governor made liberal use of and in proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and promises my answers were to this purpose that my circumstances thanks to god were such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me and that being a member of the assembly i could not possibly accept of any that however i had no personal enmity to the proprietary and that whenever the public measures he propos d should appear to be for the good of the people no one should espouse and forward them more zealously than myself my past opposition having been founded on this that the measures which had been urged were evidently intended to serve the proprietary interest with great prejudice to that of the people that i was much obliged to him the governor for his professions of regard to me and that he might rely on everything in my power to make his administration as easy as possible hoping at the same time that he had not brought with him the same unfortunate instruction his predecessor had been hampered with on this he did not then explain himself but when he afterwards came to do business with the assembly they appear d again the disputes were renewed and i was as active as ever in the opposition being the penman first of the request to have a communication of the instructions and then of the remarks upon them which may be found in the votes of the time and in the historical review i afterward publish d but between us personally no enmity arose we were often together he was a man of letters had seen much of the world and was very entertaining and pleasing in conversation he gave me the first information that my old friend jas ralph was still alive that he was esteem d one of the best political writers in england had been employed in the dispute between prince frederic and the king and had obtain d a pension of three hundred a year that his reputation was indeed small as a poet pope having damned his poetry in the dunciad but his prose was thought as good as any man s quarrel between george ii and his son frederick prince of wales who died before his father a satirical poem by alexander pope directed against various contemporary writers the assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted in manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only with the privileges of the people but with the service of the crown resolv d to petition the king against them and appointed me their agent to go over to england to present and support the petition the house had sent up a bill to the governor granting a sum of sixty thousand pounds for the king s use ten thousand pounds of which was subjected to the orders of the then general lord loudoun which the governor absolutely refus d to pass in compliance with his instructions i had agreed with captain morris of the packet at new york for my passage and my stores were put on board when lord loudoun arriv d at philadelphia expressly as he told me to endeavour an accommodation between the governor and assembly that his majesty s service might not be obstructed by their dissensions accordingly he desir d the governor and myself to meet him that he might hear what was to be said on both sides we met and discussed the business in behalf of the assembly i urged all the various arguments that may be found in the public papers of that time which were of my writing and are printed with the minutes of the assembly and the governor pleaded his instructions the bond he had given to observe them and his ruin if he disobey d yet seemed not unwilling to hazard himself if lord loudoun would advise it this his lordship did not chuse to do though i once thought i had nearly prevail d with him to do it but finally he rather chose to urge the compliance of the assembly and he entreated me to use my endeavours with them for that purpose declaring that he would spare none of the king s troops for the defense of our frontiers and that if we did not continue to provide for that defense ourselves they must remain expos d to the enemy i acquainted the house with what had pass d and presenting them with a set of resolutions i had drawn up declaring our rights and that we did not relinquish our claim to those rights but only suspended the exercise of them on this occasion thro force against which we protested they at length agreed to drop that bill and frame another conformable to the proprietary instructions this of course the governor pass d and i was then at liberty to proceed on my voyage but in the meantime the packet had sailed with my sea stores which was some loss to me and my only recompense was his lordship s thanks for my service all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling to his share he set out for new york before me and as the time for dispatching the packet boats was at his disposition and there were two then remaining there one of which he said was to sail very soon i requested to know the precise time that i might not miss her by any delay of mine his answer was i have given out that she is to sail on saturday next but i may let you know entre nous that if you are there by monday morning you will be in time but do not delay longer by some accidental hindrance at a ferry it was monday noon before i arrived and i was much afraid she might have sailed as the wind was fair but i was soon made easy by the information that she was still in the harbor and would not move till the next day one would imagine that i was now on the very point of departing for europe i thought so but i was not then so well acquainted with his lordship s character of which indecision was one of the strongest features i shall give some instances it was about the beginning of april that i came to new york and i think it was near the end of june before we sail d there were then two of the packet boats which had been long in port but were detained for the general s letters which were always to be ready to morrow another packet arriv d she too was detain d and before we sail d a fourth was expected ours was the first to be dispatch d as having been there longest passengers were engaged in all and some extremely impatient to be gone and the merchants uneasy about their letters and the orders they had given for insurance it being war time for fall goods but their anxiety avail d nothing his lordship s letters were not ready and yet whoever waited on him found him always at his desk pen in hand and concluded he must needs write abundantly going myself one morning to pay my respects i found in his antechamber one innis a messenger of philadelphia who had come from thence express with a packet from governor denny for the general he delivered to me some letters from my friends there which occasion d my inquiring when he was to return and where he lodg d that i might send some letters by him he told me he was order d to call to morrow at nine for the general s answer to the governor and should set off immediately i put my letters into his hands the same day a fortnight after i met him again in the same place so you are soon return d innis return d no i am not gone yet how so i have called here by order every morning these two weeks past for his lordship s letter and it is not yet ready is it possible when he is so great a writer for i see him constantly at his escritoire yes says innis but he is like st george on the signs always on horseback and never rides on this observation of the messenger was it seems well founded for when in england i understood that mr pitt gave it as one reason for removing this general and sending generals amherst and wolfe that the minister never heard from him and could not know what he was doing william pitt first earl of chatham a great english statesman and orator under his able administration england won canada from france he was a friend of america at the time of our revolution this daily expectation of sailing and all the three packets going down to sandy hook to join the fleet there the passengers thought it best to be on board lest by a sudden order the ships should sail and they be left behind there if i remember right we were about six weeks consuming our sea stores and oblig d to procure more at length the fleet sail d the general and all his army on board bound to louisburg with the intent to besiege and take that fortress all the packet boats in company ordered to attend the general s ship ready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready we were out five days before we got a letter with leave to part and then our ship quitted the fleet and steered for england the other two packets he still detained carried them with him to halifax where he stayed some time to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts then altered his mind as to besieging louisburg and returned to new york with all his troops together with the two packets above mentioned and all their passengers during his absence the french and savages had taken fort george on the frontier of that province and the savages had massacred many of the garrison after capitulation i saw afterwards in london captain bonnell who commanded one of those packets he told me that when he had been detain d a month he acquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul to a degree that must necessarily hinder her fast sailing a point of consequence for a packet boat and requested an allowance of time to heave her down and clean her bottom he was asked how long time that would require he answered three days the general replied if you can do it in one day i give leave otherwise not for you must certainly sail the day after to morrow so he never obtain d leave though detained afterwards from day to day during full three months i saw also in london one of bonnell s passengers who was so enrag d against his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so long at new york and then carrying him to halifax and back again that he swore he would sue him for damages whether he did or not i never heard but as he represented the injury to his affairs it was very considerable on the whole i wonder d much how such a man came to be intrusted with so important a business as the conduct of a great army but having since seen more of the great world and the means of obtaining and motives for giving places my wonder is diminished general shirley on whom the command of the army devolved upon the death of braddock would in my opinion if continued in place have made a much better campaign than that of loudoun in which was frivolous expensive and disgraceful to our nation beyond conception for tho shirley was not a bred soldier he was sensible and sagacious in himself and attentive to good advice from others capable of forming judicious plans and quick and active in carrying them into execution loudoun instead of defending the colonies with his great army left them totally expos d while he paraded idly at halifax by which means fort george was lost besides he derang d all our mercantile operations and distress d our trade by a long embargo on the exportation of provisions on pretence of keeping supplies from being obtain d by the enemy but in reality for beating down their price in favour of the contractors in whose profits it was said perhaps from suspicion only he had a share and when at length the embargo was taken off by neglecting to send notice of it to charlestown the carolina fleet was detain d near three months longer whereby their bottoms were so much damaged by the worm that a great part of them foundered in their passage home this relation illustrates the corruption that characterized english public life in the eighteenth century see page it was gradually overcome in the early part of the next century shirley was i believe sincerely glad of being relieved from so burdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a man unacquainted with military business i was at the entertainment given by the city of new york to lord loudoun on his taking upon him the command shirley tho thereby superseded was present also there was a great company of officers citizens and strangers and some chairs having been borrowed in the neighborhood there was one among them very low which fell to the lot of mr shirley perceiving it as i sat by him i said they have given you sir too low a seat no matter says he mr franklin i find a low seat the easiest while i was as afore mention d detain d at new york i receiv d all the accounts of the provisions etc that i had furnish d to braddock some of which accounts could not sooner be obtain d from the different persons i had employ d to assist in the business i presented them to lord loudoun desiring to be paid the balance he caus d them to be regularly examined by the proper officer who after comparing every article with its voucher certified them to be right and the balance due for which his lordship promis d to give me an order on the paymaster this was however put off from time to time and tho i call d often for it by appointment i did not get it at length just before my departure he told me he had on better consideration concluded not to mix his accounts with those of his predecessors and you says he when in england have only to exhibit your accounts at the treasury and you will be paid immediately i mention d but without effect the great and unexpected expense i had been put to by being detain d so long at new york as a reason for my desiring to be presently paid and on my observing that it was not right i should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining the money i had advanc d as i charged no commission for my service o sir says he you must not think of persuading us that you are no gainer we understand better those affairs and know that every one concerned in supplying the army finds means in the doing it to fill his own pockets i assur d him that was not my case and that i had not pocketed a farthing but he appear d clearly not to believe me and indeed i have since learnt that immense fortunes are often made in such employments as to my balance i am not paid it to this day of which more hereafter our captain of the paquet had boasted much before we sailed of the swiftness of his ship unfortunately when we came to sea she proved the dullest of ninety six sail to his no small mortification after many conjectures respecting the cause when we were near another ship almost as dull as ours which however gain d upon us the captain ordered all hands to come aft and stand as near the ensign staff as possible we were passengers included about forty persons while we stood there the ship mended her pace and soon left her neighbour far behind which prov d clearly what our captain suspected that she was loaded too much by the head the casks of water it seems had been all plac d forward these he therefore order d to be mov d further aft on which the ship recover d her character and proved the best sailer in the fleet the captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots which is accounted thirteen miles per hour we had on board as a passenger captain kennedy of the navy who contended that it was impossible and that no ship ever sailed so fast and that there must have been some error in the division of the log line or some mistake in heaving the log a wager ensu d between the two captains to be decided when there should be sufficient wind kennedy thereupon examin d rigorously the log line and being satisfi d with that he determin d to throw the log himself accordingly some days after when the wind blew very fair and fresh and the captain of the paquet lutwidge said he believ d she then went at the rate of thirteen knots kennedy made the experiment and own d his wager lost a piece of wood shaped and weighted so as to keep it stable when in the water to this is attached a line knotted at regular distances by these devices it is possible to tell the speed of a ship the above fact i give for the sake of the following observation it has been remark d as an imperfection in the art of ship building that it can never be known till she is tried whether a new ship will or will not be a good sailer for that the model of a good sailing ship has been exactly follow d in a new one which has prov d on the contrary remarkably dull i apprehend that this may partly be occasion d by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modes of lading rigging and sailing of a ship each has his system and the same vessel laden by the judgment and orders of one captain shall sail better or worse than when by the orders of another besides it scarce ever happens that a ship is form d fitted for the sea and sail d by the same person one man builds the hull another rigs her a third lades and sails her no one of these has the advantage of knowing all the ideas and experience of the others and therefore cannot draw just conclusions from a combination of the whole even in the simple operation of sailing when at sea i have often observ d different judgments in the officers who commanded the successive watches the wind being the same one would have the sails trimm d sharper or flatter than another so that they seem d to have no certain rule to govern by yet i think a set of experiments might be instituted first to determine the most proper form of the hull for swift sailing next the best dimensions and properest place for the masts then the form and quantity of sails and their position as the wind may be and lastly the disposition of the lading this is an age of experiments and i think a set accurately made and combin d would be of great use i am persuaded therefore that ere long some ingenious philosopher will undertake it to whom i wish success illustration sailing ship we were several times chas d in our passage but out sail d every thing and in thirty days had soundings we had a good observation and the captain judg d himself so near our port falmouth that if we made a good run in the night we might be off the mouth of that harbor in the morning and by running in the night might escape the notice of the enemy s privateers who often cruis d near the entrance of the channel accordingly all the sail was set that we could possibly make and the wind being very fresh and fair we went right before it and made great way the captain after his observation shap d his course as he thought so as to pass wide of the scilly isles but it seems there is sometimes a strong indraught setting up st george s channel which deceives seamen and caused the loss of sir cloudesley shovel s squadron this indraught was probably the cause of what happened to us we had a watchman plac d in the bow to whom they often called look well out before there and he as often answered ay ay but perhaps had his eyes shut and was half asleep at the time they sometimes answering as is said mechanically for he did not see a light just before us which had been hid by the studding sails from the man at the helm and from the rest of the watch but by an accidental yaw of the ship was discover d and occasion d a great alarm we being very near it the light appearing to me as big as a cartwheel it was midnight and our captain fast asleep but captain kennedy jumping upon deck and seeing the danger ordered the ship to wear round all sails standing an operation dangerous to the masts but it carried us clear and we escaped shipwreck for we were running right upon the rocks on which the lighthouse was erected this deliverance impressed me strongly with the utility of lighthouses and made me resolve to encourage the building more of them in america if i should live to return there in the morning it was found by the soundings etc that we were near our port but a thick fog hid the land from our sight about nine o clock the fog began to rise and seem d to be lifted up from the water like the curtain at a play house discovering underneath the town of falmouth the vessels in its harbor and the fields that surrounded it this was a most pleasing spectacle to those who had been so long without any other prospects than the uniform view of a vacant ocean and it gave us the more pleasure as we were now free from the anxieties which the state of war occasion d i set out immediately with my son for london and we only stopt a little by the way to view stonehenge on salisbury plain and lord pembroke s house and gardens with his very curious antiquities at wilton we arrived in london the th of july a celebrated prehistoric ruin probably of a temple built by the early britons near salisbury england it consists of inner and outer circles of enormous stones some of which are connected by stone slabs here terminates the autobiography as published by wm temple franklin and his successors what follows was written in the last year of dr franklin s life and was never before printed in english mr bigelow s note in his edition of as soon as i was settled in a lodging mr charles had provided for me i went to visit dr fothergill to whom i was strongly recommended and whose counsel respecting my proceedings i was advis d to obtain he was against an immediate complaint to government and thought the proprietaries should first be personally appli d to who might possibly be induc d by the interposition and persuasion of some private friends to accommodate matters amicably i then waited on my old friend and correspondent mr peter collinson who told me that john hanbury the great virginia merchant had requested to be informed when i should arrive that he might carry me to lord granville s who was then president of the council and wished to see me as soon as possible i agreed to go with him the next morning accordingly mr hanbury called for me and took me in his carriage to that nobleman s who receiv d me with great civility and after some questions respecting the present state of affairs in america and discourse thereupon he said to me you americans have wrong ideas of the nature of your constitution you contend that the king s instructions to his governors are not laws and think yourselves at liberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion but those instructions are not like the pocket instructions given to a minister going abroad for regulating his conduct in some trifling point of ceremony they are first drawn up by judges learned in the laws they are then considered debated and perhaps amended in council after which they are signed by the king they are then so far as they relate to you the law of the land for the king is the legislator of the colonies i told his lordship this was new doctrine to me i had always understood from our charters that our laws were to be made by our assemblies to be presented indeed to the king for his royal assent but that being once given the king could not repeal or alter them and as the assemblies could not make permanent laws without his assent so neither could he make a law for them without theirs he assur d me i was totally mistaken i did not think so however and his lordship s conversation having a little alarm d me as to what might be the sentiments of the court concerning us i wrote it down as soon as i return d to my lodgings i recollected that about years before a clause in a bill brought into parliament by the ministry had propos d to make the king s instructions laws in the colonies but the clause was thrown out by the commons for which we adored them as our friends and friends of liberty till by their conduct towards us in it seem d that they had refus d that point of sovereignty to the king only that they might reserve it for themselves george granville or grenville as english premier from to he introduced the direct taxation of the american colonies and has sometimes been called the immediate cause of the revolution this whole passage shows how hopelessly divergent were the english and american views on the relations between the mother country and her colonies grenville here made clear that the americans were to have no voice in making or amending their laws parliament and the king were to have absolute power over the colonies no wonder franklin was alarmed by this new doctrine with his keen insight into human nature and his consequent knowledge of american character he foresaw the inevitable result of such an attitude on the part of england this conversation with grenville makes these last pages of the autobiography one of its most important parts after some days dr fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries they agreed to a meeting with me at mr t penn s house in spring garden the conversation at first consisted of mutual declarations of disposition to reasonable accommodations but i suppose each party had its own ideas of what should be meant by reasonable we then went into consideration of our several points of complaint which i enumerated the proprietaries justify d their conduct as well as they could and i the assembly s we now appeared very wide and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement however it was concluded that i should give them the heads of our complaints in writing and they promis d then to consider them i did so soon after but they put the paper into the hands of their solicitor ferdinand john paris who managed for them all their law business in their great suit with the neighbouring proprietary of maryland lord baltimore which had subsisted years and wrote for them all their papers and messages in their dispute with the assembly he was a proud angry man and as i had occasionally in the answers of the assembly treated his papers with some severity they being really weak in point of argument and haughty in expression he had conceived a mortal enmity to me which discovering itself whenever we met i declin d the proprietary s proposal that he and i should discuss the heads of complaint between our two selves and refus d treating with anyone but them they then by his advice put the paper into the hands of the attorney and solicitor general for their opinion and counsel upon it where it lay unanswered a year wanting eight days during which time i made frequent demands of an answer from the proprietaries but without obtaining any other than that they had not yet received the opinion of the attorney and solicitor general what it was when they did receive it i never learnt for they did not communicate it to me but sent a long message to the assembly drawn and signed by paris reciting my paper complaining of its want of formality as a rudeness on my part and giving a flimsy justification of their conduct adding that they should be willing to accommodate matters if the assembly would send out some person of candour to treat with them for that purpose intimating thereby that i was not such illustration we now appeared very wide and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement the want of formality or rudeness was probably my not having address d the paper to them with their assum d titles of true and absolute proprietaries of the province of pennsylvania which i omitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper the intention of which was only to reduce to a certainty by writing what in conversation i had delivered viva voce but during this delay the assembly having prevailed with gov r denny to pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common with the estates of the people which was the grand point in dispute they omitted answering the message when this act however came over the proprietaries counselled by paris determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent accordingly they petitioned the king in council and a hearing was appointed in which two lawyers were employ d by them against the act and two by me in support of it they alledg d that the act was intended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare those of the people and that if it were suffer d to continue in force and the proprietaries who were in odium with the people left to their mercy in proportioning the taxes they would inevitably be ruined we reply d that the act had no such intention and would have no such effect that the assessors were honest and discreet men under an oath to assess fairly and equitably and that any advantage each of them might expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting that of the proprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves this is the purport of what i remember as urged by both sides except that we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequences that must attend a repeal for that the money being printed and given to the king s use expended in his service and now spread among the people the repeal would strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of many and the total discouragement of future grants and the selfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such a general catastrophe merely from a groundless fear of their estate being taxed too highly was insisted on in the strongest terms on this lord mansfield one of the counsel rose and beckoning me took me into the clerk s chamber while the lawyers were pleading and asked me if i was really of opinion that no injury would be done the proprietary estate in the execution of the act i said certainly then says he you can have little objection to enter into an engagement to assure that point i answer d none at all he then call d in paris and after some discourse his lordship s proposition was accepted on both sides a paper to the purpose was drawn up by the clerk of the council which i sign d with mr charles who was also an agent of the province for their ordinary affairs when lord mansfield returned to the council chamber where finally the law was allowed to pass some changes were however recommended and we also engaged they should be made by a subsequent law but the assembly did not think them necessary for one year s tax having been levied by the act before the order of council arrived they appointed a committee to examine the proceedings of the assessors and on this committee they put several particular friends of the proprietaries after a full enquiry they unanimously sign d a report that they found the tax had been assess d with perfect equity the assembly looked into my entering into the first part of the engagement as an essential service to the province since it secured the credit of the paper money then spread over all the country they gave me their thanks in form when i return d but the proprietaries were enraged at governor denny for having pass d the act and turn d him out with threats of suing him for breach of instructions which he had given bond to observe he however having done it at the instance of the general and for his majesty s service and having some powerful interest at court despis d the threats and they were never put in execution unfinished illustration medal with inscription benj franlin natus boston xvii jan mdccvi appendix electrical kite to peter collinson philadelphia oct sir as frequent mention is made in public papers from europe of the success of the philadelphia experiment for drawing the electric fire from clouds by means of pointed rods of iron erected on high buildings c it may be agreeable to the curious to be informed that the same experiment has succeeded in philadelphia though made in a different and more easy manner which is as follows make a small cross of two light strips of cedar the arms so long as to reach to the four corners of a large thin silk handkerchief when extended tie the corners of the handkerchief to the extremities of the cross so you have the body of a kite which being properly accommodated with a tail loop and string will rise in the air like those made of paper but this being of silk is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a thunder gust without tearing to the top of the upright stick of the cross is to be fixed a very sharp pointed wire rising a foot or more above the wood to the end of the twine next the hand is to be tied a silk ribbon and where the silk and twine join a key may be fastened this kite is to be raised when a thunder gust appears to be coming on and the person who holds the string must stand within a door or window or under some cover so that the silk ribbon may not be wet and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame of the door or window as soon as any of the thunder clouds come over the kite the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them and the kite with all the twine will be electrified and the loose filaments of the twine will stand out every way and be attracted by an approaching finger and when the rain has wet the kite and twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely you will find it stream out plentifully from the key on the approach of your knuckle at this key the phial may be charged and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled and all the electric experiments be performed which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube and thereby the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning completely demonstrated b franklin illustration you will find it stream out plentifully from

york public library the way to wealth from father abraham s speech forming the preface to poor richard s almanac for it would be thought a hard government that should tax its people one tenth part of their time to be employed in its service but idleness taxes many of us much more if we reckon all that is spent in absolute sloth or doing of nothing with that which is spent in idle employments or amusements that amount to nothing sloth by bringing on diseases absolutely shortens life sloth like rust consumes faster than labor wears while the used key is always bright as poor richard says but dost thou love life then do not squander time for that s the stuff life is made of as poor richard says how much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep forgetting that the sleeping fox catches no poultry and that there will be sleeping enough in the grave as poor richard says if time be of all things the most precious wasting time must be as poor richard says the greatest prodigality since as he elsewhere tells us lost time is never found again and what we call time enough always proves little enough let us then up and be doing and doing to the purpose so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity sloth makes all things difficult but industry all easy as poor richard says and he that riseth late must trot all day and shall scarce overtake his business at night while laziness travels so slowly that poverty soon overtakes him as we read in poor richard who adds drive thy business let not that drive thee and early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise industry need not wish and he that lives upon hope will die fasting there are no gains without pains he that hath a trade hath an estate and he that hath a calling hath an office of profit and honor but then the trade must be worked at and the calling well followed or neither the estate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes what though you have found no treasure nor has any rich relation left you a legacy diligence is the mother of good luck as poor richard says and god gives all things to industry one to day is worth two to morrows and farther have you somewhat to do to morrow do it to day if you were a servant would you not be ashamed that a good master should catch you idle are you then your own master be ashamed to catch yourself idle stick to it steadily and you will see great effects for constant dropping wears away stones and by diligence and patience the mouse ate in two the cable and little strokes fell great oaks methinks i hear some of you say must a man afford himself no leisure i will tell thee my friend what poor richard says employ thy time well if thou meanest to gain leisure and since thou art not sure of a minute throw not away an hour leisure is time for doing something useful this leisure the diligent man will obtain but the lazy man never so that as poor richard says a life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things keep thy shop and thy shop will keep thee and again if you would have your business done go if not send if you would have a faithful servant and one that you like serve yourself a little neglect may breed great mischief adding for want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of a shoe the horse was lost and for want of a horse the rider was lost being overtaken and slain by the enemy all for the want of care about a horse shoe nail so much for industry my friends and attention to one s own business but to these we must add frugality what maintains one vice would bring up two children you may think perhaps that a little tea or a little punch now and then diet a little more costly clothes a little finer and a little entertainment now and then can be no great matter but remember what poor richard says many a little makes a mickle beware of little expenses a small leak will sink a great ship and again who dainties love shall beggars prove and moreover fools make feasts and wise men eat them buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries if you would know the value of money go and try to borrow some for he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing the second vice is lying the first is running in debt lying rides upon debt s back poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue tis hard for an empty bag to stand upright and now to conclude experience keeps a dear school but fools will learn in no other and scarce in that for it is true we may give advice but we cannot give conduct as poor richard says however remember this they that won t be counseled can t be helped as poor richard says and farther that if you will not hear reason she ll surely rap your knuckles the whistle to madame brillon passy november i am charmed with your description of paradise and with your plan of living there and i approve much of your conclusion that in the meantime we should draw all the good we can from this world in my opinion we might all draw more good from it than we do and suffer less evil if we would take care not to give too much for whistles for to me it seems that most of the unhappy people we meet with are become so by neglect of that caution you ask what i mean you love stories and will excuse my telling one of myself when i was a child of seven year old my friends on a holiday filled my pocket with coppers i went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children and being charmed with the sound of a whistle that i met by the way in the hands of another boy i voluntarily offered and gave all my money for one i then came home and went whistling all over the house much pleased with my whistle but disturbing all the family my brothers and sisters and cousins understanding the bargain i had made told me i had given four times as much for it as it was worth put me in mind what good things i might have bought with the rest of the money and laughed at me so much for my folly that i cried with vexation and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure this however was afterwards of use to me the impression continuing on my mind so that often when i was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing i said to myself don t give too much for the whistle and i saved my money as i grew up came into the world and observed the actions of men i thought i met with many very many who gave too much for the whistle when i saw one too ambitious of court favor sacrificing his time in attendance on levees his repose his liberty his virtue and perhaps his friends to attain it i have said to myself this man gives too much for his whistle when i saw another fond of popularity constantly employing himself in political bustles neglecting his own affairs and ruining them by neglect he pays indeed said i too much for his whistle if i knew a miser who gave up every kind of comfortable living all the pleasure of doing good to others all the esteem of his fellow citizens and the joys of benevolent friendship for the sake of accumulating wealth poor man said i you pay too much for your whistle when i met with a man of pleasure sacrificing every laudable improvement of the mind or of his fortune to mere corporeal sensations and ruining his health in their pursuit mistaken man said i you are providing pain for yourself instead of pleasure you give too much for your whistle if i see one fond of appearance or fine clothes fine houses fine furniture fine equipages all above his fortune for which he contracts debts and ends his career in a prison alas say i he has paid dear very dear for his whistle when i see a beautiful sweet tempered girl married to an ill natured brute of a husband what a pity say i that she should pay so much for a whistle in short i conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value of things and by their giving too much for their whistles yet i ought to have charity for these unhappy people when i consider that with all this wisdom of which i am boasting there are certain things in the world so tempting for example the apples of king john which happily are not to be bought for if they were put to sale by auction i might very easily be led to ruin myself in the purchase and find that i had once more given too much for the whistle adieu my dear friend and believe me ever yours very sincerely and with unalterable affection b franklin a letter to samuel mather passy may revd sir it is now more than years since i left boston but i remember well both your father and grandfather having heard them both in the pulpit and seen them in their houses the last time i saw your father was in the beginning of when i visited him after my first trip to pennsylvania he received me in his library and on my taking leave showed me a shorter way out of the house through a narrow passage which was crossed by a beam overhead we were still talking as i withdrew he accompanying me behind and i turning partly towards him when he said hastily stoop stoop i did not understand him till i felt my head hit against the beam he was a man that never missed any occasion of giving instruction and upon this he said to me you are young and have the world before you stoop as you go through it and you will miss many hard thumps this advice thus beat into my head has frequently been of use to me and i often

to proceed in upon a view of chambers s great dictionaries from whence were taken the materials of the universal instructor in all arts and sciences which usually made the first part of this paper we find that besides their containing many things abstruse or insignificant to us it will probably be fifty years before the whole can be gone thro in this manner of publication there are likewise in those books continual references from things under one letter of the alphabet to those under another which relate to the same subject and are necessary to explain and compleat it those are taken in their turn may perhaps be ten years distant and since it is likely that they who desire to acquaint themselves with any particular art or science would gladly have the whole before them in a much less time we believe our readers will not think such a method of communicating knowledge to be a proper one however tho we do not intend to continue the publication of those dictionaries in a regular alphabetical method as has hitherto been done yet as several things exhibited from them in the course of these papers have been entertaining to such of the curious who never had and cannot have the advantage of good libraries and as there are many things still behind which being in this manner made generally known may perhaps become of considerable use by giving such hints to the excellent natural genius s of our country as may contribute either to the improvement of our present manufactures or towards the invention of new ones we propose from time to time to communicate such particular

have long desired to see a good news paper in pennsylvania and we hope those gentlemen who are able will contribute towards the making this such we ask assistance because we are fully sensible that to

languages a great easiness and command of writing and relating things cleanly and intelligibly and in few words he should be able to speak of war both by land and sea be well acquainted with geography with the history of the time with the several interests of princes and states the secrets of courts and the manners and customs of all nations men thus accomplish d are very rare in this remote part of the world and it would be well if the writer of these papers could make up among his friends what is wanting in himself upon the whole we may assure the publick that as far as the encouragement we meet with will enable us no care and pains shall be omitted that may make the pennsylvania gazette as agreeable and useful an entertainment as the nature of the thing will allow the following is the last message sent by his excellency governor burnet to the house of representatives in boston gentlemen of the house of representatives it is not with so vain a hope as to convince you that i take the trouble to answer your messages but if possible to open the eyes of the deluded people whom you represent and whom you are at so much pains to keep in ignorance of the true state of their affairs i
